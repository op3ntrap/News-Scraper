                        <ul>
                            <li>On June 21, the Karnataka assembly Speaker ordered the imprisonment of two journalists
                                for a year based on recommendations in two separate reports of its privilege committees
                            </li>
                            <li>Though dozens of people are summoned every year before the privileges committees of
                                Parliament and state legislatures on charges of breach of privilege of legislators, it
                                is rare that punitive action like imprisonment has been ordered
                            </li>
                            <li>With no codified laws for what constitutes a breach of privilege offence or
                                prescriptions for punishment, this is largely a grey area in legal terms
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>What provisions of the Constitution protect the privileges of the
                            legislature?</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Article 105 pertains to the powers, privileges, etc, of Parliament, its members and
                                committees
                            </li>
                            <li>Article 194, which is identical to 105, protects the privileges and powers of the houses
                                of legislature, their members and committees in the states
                            </li>
                            <li>These sections protect the freedom of speech of parliamentarians and legislators</li>
                            <li>Insulate them against litigation over matters that occur in these houses, and</li>
                            <li>Give powers to define the powers, privileges and immunities of a house, its members and
                                committees
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>What are the origins of the privileges?</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>These are derived from the British House of Commons</li>
                            <li>The privileges are reported to have originated when a nascent British parliament was
                                attempting to establish itself in the light of monarchy
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>What constitutes a breach of privilege?</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>These powers and privileges are not codified</li>
                            <li>There are no clearly laid out rules on what constitutes breach of privilege and what
                                punishment it entails
                            </li>
                            <li>In Karnataka, privileges panels often refer to Practice and Procedure of Parliament by M
                                N Kaul to define breach of privilege
                            </li>
                            <li>As per book, “It is a breach of privilege and contempt of the House to make speeches or
                                to print or publish any libel reflecting on the character or proceedings of the house,
                                its committees or any member of the house relating to his character or conduct as a
                                member of Parliament”
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>What is the criticism of this provision?</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is sometimes used to counter media criticism of legislators and as a substitute for
                                legal proceedings
                            </li>
                            <li>All persons have a right to trial by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal
                            </li>
                            <li>Breach of privilege laws allow politicians to become judges in their own cause, raising
                                concerns of conflict of interest and violating basic fair trial guarantees
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>What is the procedure in privilege cases?</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>All state legislatures have special privilege committees comprising 10 to 12 legislators
                                as members and usually headed by a senior politician from the ruling party
                            </li>
                            <li>Whenever a legislator has a complaint he can send a letter to the committee</li>
                            <li>These matters can pertain to the sidelining of a legislator by government employees when
                                it comes to projects and initiatives, impolite behaviour by government servants, not
                                being invited to public events etc
                            </li>
                            <li>The committee will begin proceedings as per the Criminal Procedure Code</li>
                            <li>The accused person is summoned and an inquiry is conducted by the committee and based on
                                findings a recommendation is made to the legislature
                            </li>
                            <li>When the matter is tabled in the legislature, a debate can be initiated on the report
                            </li>
                            <li>Based on the assertions of the House the Speaker can order the punishment as defined by
                                the privileges committee or order otherwise
                            </li>

                                surface-to-air missiles (MRSAMs),</strong> the biggest such deal for the Israeli

                                    that it could pose challenges on account of several factors — <strong>especially the

                                    its biggest benefit would be the integration of the Indian economy into a single

                                                <li>Kanyashree’s core objectives are simple and focussed: it aims to
                                                    ensure that girls stay in school and delay their marriages till at
                                                    least age 18. Kanyashree’s approach is also simple: it uses a social
                                                    safety net mechanism that has shown a high degree of success in
                                                    transforming the lives of children and adolescents in several
                                                    countries in the world: Conditional Cash Transfers. The scheme has
                                                    two cash transfer components:
                                                </li>
                                                <li>The first is an Annual Scholarship of Rs. 750/- to be paid annually
                                                    to the girls in the age group 13 to 18 years (studying in Class VIII
                                                    equivalent or above for every year that they remained in education,

                                                <li>The second is a One-Time Grant of Rs. 25,000/-, to be paid after a
                                                    girl turns 18, provided that she was engaged in an academic or
                                                    occupational pursuit and was unmarried.

                                                    courses available for this age group. Given that children from
                                                    socio-economically disadvantaged families are more vulnerable to
                                                    child marriage, the scheme is open only to girls from families whose
                                                    annual income is Rs. 1,20,000/- or less. For girls with special

                                                    waived. Girls with special needs, but in a class below class VIII,
                                                    can also apply for the annual scholarship.

                                                    time, and complete secondary or higher secondary education, or
                                                    equivalent in technical or vocational steams, thereby giving them a
                                                    better footing in both the economic and social spheres.

                                                    of marriage, thereby reducing the risks of early pregnancies,
                                                    associated risks of maternal and child mortality, and other
                                                    debilitating health conditions, including those of malnutrition.

                                                <li>It was also decided that the Scheme should confer more than just
                                                    monetary support; it should be a means of financial inclusion and a
                                                    tool of empowerment for adolescent girls. The scheme’s benefits are
                                                    therefore paid directly to bank accounts in the girls’ names,
                                                    leaving the decision of utilization of the money in their hands.

                                                <li>To reinforce the positive impact of increased education and delayed
                                                    marriages, the scheme also works to enhance the social power and
                                                    self-esteem of girls through a targeted behaviour change
                                                    communication strategy. The communication strategy not only builds
                                                    awareness of the scheme, but includes adolescent-friendly approaches
                                                    like events, competitions and Kanyashree clubs, and the endorsement
                                                    of strong women figures as role models to promote social and
                                                    psychological empowerment.

                                            </ul>
                                            <p>As more and more girls remain in school, it is envisaged that they will
                                                use the opportunity to gain skills and knowledge that will help them
                                                become economically independent. Even if girls do get married soon after
                                                they turn 18, it is expected that their education and enhanced social
                                                and emotional development will give them a better foundation for in
                                                their adult lives. And over time, as entire generations of women enter
                                                marriages only after they have some degree of economic independence, it
                                                is expected that the practice of child marriage is completely
                                                eradicated, and women will attain their right to health, education and
                                                socio-economic equality.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Scheme is set to cover all blocks of the country, involving a total of 6.40 lakh
                                villages over the span of next 3 years
                            </li>
                            <li>This Mission is part of the <strong>‘Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat’</strong></li>
                            <li>Ministry of Culture launched it in the year of commemoration of the birth centenary of
                                Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay, who hailed from Mathura.
                            </li>
                            <li>The Cultural Mapping of India portal will serve as a repository/consolidated database of
                                information about cultural assets and resources i.e. a cultural inventory at one place
                                for essential planning, sustainable economic development and for preserving the
                                scattered and near extinct art forms.

                        <p><strong>Key Point:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The mission aims at converting the vast and widespread cultural canvas of India into an
                                objective cultural map, designing a mechanism to fulfil the aspirations of the whole
                                artist community of the nation and preserving the rich cultural heritage of this country
                                in the form of a cultural repository of artists and art forms.
                            </li>
                            <li>Mission encompasses data mapping, demography building formalising the processes and
                                bringing all the cultural activities under one web based umbrella for better results.
                            </li>
                            <li>The Mission also seeks to open a direct channel of communication of artists with the
                                Government and peer to peer communication among artists for talent honing and
                                handholding of each other.

                        <p><strong>Main vision:</strong> no cultural talent or heritage should remain unattended and if
                            it is talent, it should be nurtured and if it is a heritage, it should be conserved and used
                            as an icon to learn from the past, and also to propagate our cultural talent across all
                            boundaries.</p>

                        <p><strong>In news:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The norms for <strong>no-fly list </strong>to rein in unruly passengers are expected to
                                be ready early next month, the government said.
                            </li>
                            <li>The civil aviation ministry has already come out with draft rules for a ‘national no-fly
                                list’ of unruly passengers for all domestic carriers, under which the flying ban could
                                extend from at <strong>least three months to an indefinite period.</strong></li>
                            <li>As per the draft norms, the national no-fly list will include names of passengers
                                identified as unruly after an inquiry by a committee constituted by a particular
                                airline.
                            </li>
                            <li>A person identified as a threat by security agencies would also be included in this
                                list.
                            </li>
                            <li>While the list is characterised as ‘national’ and would have data on disruptive
                                passengers from all airlines, the ban recommended by the committee is not mandatory for
                                all airlines to follow.
                            </li>
                            <li>The government had recommended three levels of unruly behaviours, each with a
                                corresponding duration of flying ban.
                            </li>
                            <li>The first level of misdemeanour includes disruptive behaviour such as physical gestures,
                                verbal harassment and unruly behaviour because of inebriation. This level of offence
                                would carry a flying ban of three months.
                            </li>
                            <li>The second level relates to physically abusive behaviour such as pushing, hitting,
                                grabbing, inappropriate touching or sexual harassment. Such actions could attract a
                                six—month ban.
                            </li>
                            <li>The third category pertains to life threatening behaviour such as damage to aircraft
                                operating system, physical violence and attempted breach of flight crew compartment. In
                                such instances, the ban could be for two years or an indefinite period.
                            </li>
                            <li>If a passenger repeats the same degree of offence, he or she would be banned for twice
                                the period of the previous ban.
                            </li>

                        <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The government has made Aadhaar mandatory for access to banking and filing I-T
                                returns.
                            </li>
                            <li>But there are serious concerns about possible breach of privacy with private entities
                                having access to Aadhaar data
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Is Aadhaar mandatory?</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Supreme Court has more than once told the government not to make Aadhaar mandatory
                                for citizens.
                            </li>
                            <li>In 2015, on two occasions, the Supreme Court ruled that “it is not mandatory for a
                                citizen to obtain an Aadhaar card” asking the government to advertise this prominently.
                            </li>
                            <li>The production of an Aadhaar card will not be condition for obtaining any benefits
                                otherwise due to a citizen, the Supreme Court had said. <strong>However, the apex court
                                    has allowed the government to link various schemes including MNREGS, LPG, PDS, EPFO,
                                    Old Age Pension etc with Aadhaar.</strong></li>
                            <li>But, the Supreme Court ruling in 2015 clearly read, “… the Aadhaar card Scheme is purely
                                voluntary and it cannot be made mandatory till the matter is finally decided by this
                                Court one way or the other.”
                            </li>
                            <li>The apex court has set up a constitutional bench to hear Aadhaar case. The Aadhaar Act
                                2016 also does not make Aadhaar mandatory for citizens.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>HOW GOVERNMENT MADE IT MANDATORY?</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Budget 2017 (passed by Parliament), which mandated seeding of Aadhaar number with
                                Permanent Account Number (PAN).
                            </li>
                            <li>The amended Finance Act 2017. It made enrollment in Aadhaar compulsory for obtaining a
                                PAN and filing Income Tax returns.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Implications:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Finance Act effectively meant that an earning member of Indian society is a
                                potential criminal if s/he does not have an Aadhaar as the citizen would not be able to
                                file I-T returns, which s/he is legally bound to do.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>ARE AADHAAR DATA IN SAFE HANDS?</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Recently a report by the Centre for Internet Society said that more than 13 crore
                                Aadhaar data were leaked, stolen or compromised.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Section 29 of the Aadhaar Act</strong> prohibits sharing, publishing, displaying
                                or posting publicly the core biometric information collected under the project except in
                                <strong>“the interest of national security</strong>“. <strong>However, the Act does not
                                    state what constitutes national security.</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Section 57 of the Aadhaar Act, 2016</strong> <strong>allows private companies to
                                use the Aadhaar data to establish “identity of an individual for any purpose”.</strong>
                            </li>

                                        <p>Abhang or abhanga is a form of devotional poetry sung in praise of the Hindu
                                            god Vitthala, also known as Vithoba. The word “abhang” comes from a for
                                            “non-” and bhang for “ending” or “interrupting”, in other words, a flawless,
                                            continuous process, in this case referring to a poem.By contrast, the
                                            devotional songs known as Bhajans focus on the inward journey. Abhangs are
                                            more exuberant expressions of the communitarian experience.Abhanga is
                                            considered a form of the ovi. Abhangs are sung during pilgrimage to the
                                            temples of Pandharpur, by the devotees.</p>
                                        <p>It is said that over 5000 Abhangas were written by Sant Tukaram.</p></div>

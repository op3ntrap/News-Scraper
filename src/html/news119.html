                <p><strong>In news:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The NHRC has issued notices to the governments and police chiefs of Tamil Nadu and Andhra
                        Pradesh over the alleged inhuman treatment being meted out to girls and women who are forcibly
                        taken to temples as part of an old ritual that resembles the banned Devadasi system.
                    </li>
                    <li>The girls and women are taken to temples of Goddess Mathamma for “offering” in Thiruvallur
                        district of Tamil Nadu and adjoining places.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Practice:</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <ol>
                    <li>As a part of the ritual, the girls are dressed up as a bride and once the ceremony is over,
                        their dresses are removed by five boys, virtually leaving them naked.
                    </li>
                    <li>They are denied to live with their families and have education.</li>
                    <li>They are forced to live in Mathamma temple deemed to be like a public property and face sexual
                        exploitation
                    </li>
                    <li>This practice is allegedly “another form of Devadasi system”, which is still practiced in some
                        parts of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>NHRC observations: </strong>The rights panel has observed that if the allegations are
                        true, these amount to violation of human rights, including the right to education, rights to
                        life and dignity besides the childrens rights.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Key Fact:</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Devadasi system</strong> is a banned religious practice in some parts of India whereby
                        parents marry a daughter to a deity or a temple.
                    </li>
                    <li>The marriage usually occurs before the girl reaches puberty.</li>
                    <li>The Union Home Ministry in December 2015 had asked all states to take strong action against
                        those involved in the heinous practice which is against the dignity of women.

            <div id="Raja Mandala">
                <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The question of a larger Indian role in securing Afghanistan is expected to figure in the talks
                        between the US Defense Secretary James Mattis and the Indian leadership.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The developments in Afghanistan in the 1970s and 1980s saw the United States deepen its
                        partnership with Pakistan to the dismay of India.
                    </li>
                    <li>Since the early 2000s, when the US warmed up to India, Afghanistan remained an area of
                        disagreement.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>New south Asian policy:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a major speech on the new administration’s policy towards South Asia, Donald Trump demanded
                        that Pakistan end its destabilisation of Afghanistan by providing safe havens to the Taliban and
                        other terror networks.
                    </li>
                    <li>Trump’s emphasis in the speech was indeed on India stepping up its economic and development
                        assistance to Afghanistan.
                    </li>
                    <li>India and the US are fully aware that without stronger external military support to Kabul, the
                        talk of development could become increasingly futile
                    </li>
                    <li>The 2011 Strategic Partnership Agreement between Delhi and Kabul explicitly called for security
                        cooperation, including the transfer of military equipment.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Delhi did not want deeper security cooperation with Afghanistan that could cast a shadow over
                        its ties with Pakistan.
                    </li>
                    <li>A second constraint has been geography. The lack of physical access has imposed substantial
                        limitations on Delhi’s military role in Afghanistan
                    </li>
                    <li>US resistance to a larger Indian security footprint in Afghanistan</li>
                    <li>The US was convinced that any Indian military role in Afghanistan would grate Pakistan’s
                        political sensitivities.
                    </li>
                    <li>But Trump has now actively encouraging India to take greater responsibilities in Afghanistan.
                    </li>
                    <li>Trump’s Indo-Pak inversion may or may not be sustainable over the long-term.</li>
                    <li>Many in Washington would want to go back to the default option of avoiding confrontation with
                        Pakistan in Afghanistan.
                    </li>

                        harvest of 138.52 mt during the previous kharif season
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Reasons: </strong>Floods and erratic rainfall in different parts of the country</li>
                    <li>The drop in output was seen across all major rain-fed crops except sugarcane</li>
                    <li>Sugarcane registered a nearly 10 per cent increase in cropping area and a corresponding increase
                        in output
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Impacts:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It may have an impact on farm incomes, which will be lower because of lower output</li>
                    <li>This would mean that the demand for other goods in rural areas will not recover the way the

                    </li>
                    <li>In other words, despite having two good monsoon in a row, private consumption expenditure will

                        Ministry’s much awaited Regional Connectivity Scheme “UDAN” (“Ude Desh Ka Aam Naagrik”) in New
                        Delhi today. UDAN is an innovative scheme to develop the regional aviation market. It is a
                        market-based mechanism in which airlines bid for seat subsidies. This first-of-its-kind scheme
                        globally will create affordable yet economically viable and profitable flights on regional
                        routes so that flying becomes affordable to the common man even in small towns.”</p></div>

                        <p><strong>Context</strong><strong> </strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The EC has written to the Law Ministry, seeking powers to act against those questioning
                                the poll panel’s credibility through unfounded allegations
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>EC requirements:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Commission has sought amendments to the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971</li>
                            <li>This is to empower it to punish anyone being disobedient or discourteous towards its
                                authority
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Examples abroad:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In its letter, the EC has cited examples of its counterparts abroad. For instance, the
                                Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), can initiate contempt proceedings against anyone
                                sullying its image. This year, the ECP issued a contempt notice to
                                cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan for accusing the election body of bias in a case
                                of foreign funding.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Reasons for seeking such powers:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The demand is made by the EC by virtue of being a constitutional authority</li>
                            <li>It is significant against the backdrop of political parties, especially Aam Aadmi Party
                                (AAP), accusing the panel of playing favourites
                            </li>
                            <li>The Commission has no specific powers to act in such cases</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>The recent case</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Matters came to light when Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal questioned election
                                commissioners A K Joti and O P Rawat’s impartiality in a media interview
                            </li>
                            <li>The decision was imperative to protect the credibility of the Commission</li>
                            <li>Kejriwal, in an interview, had alleged that two of the three election commissioners were
                                close to the ruling dispensation
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Basic information:<br/> </strong><strong>Contempt power</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Contempt of Courts Act gives power to Court to punish anyone who does its contempt</li>
                            <li>This concept / law was developed in Britain</li>
                            <li>It spread through colonialism to protect the authority and legitimacy of Court power to
                                punish for contempt provided to Judiciary
                            </li>

                            <li>In 2015, a high-level committee report submitted by Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC)
                                chief R.N. Ravi suggested changing the “misnomer” related to “free border movement” and
                                asked the government to replicate the model prevalent in villages and areas along the
                                Bangladesh border.

                                <li>The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) is an index for India which details out the
                                    growth of various sectors in an economy such as mineral mining, electricity and
                                    manufacturing.

                                <li>The all India IIP is a composite indicator that measures the short-term changes in
                                    the volume of production of a basket of industrial products during a given period
                                    with respect to that in a chosen base period.

                                <li>It is compiled and published monthly by the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO)
                                    six weeks after the reference month ends.

                                <li>The level of the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) is an abstract number, the
                                    magnitude of which represents the status of production in the industrial sector for
                                    a given period of time as compared to a reference period of time. The base year was
                                    at one time fixed at 1993–94 so that year was assigned an index level of 100.

                                <li><strong>New study and new approach:</strong> Using different parts of sunlight’s
                                    spectrum to produce crops, generate electricity, collect heat and purify water could
                                    provide food, energy and water resources for the world’s growing population.
                                </li>
                                <li>The concept works by separating and harvesting the three specific segments of the
                                    solar spectrum that are best suited to facilitate the production of food, energy and
                                    clean water.
                                </li>
                                <li>In <strong>current practices</strong>, much of this spectrum is wasted because all
                                    of the sunlight falling on a given spot is used for one purpose: agriculture, energy
                                    production or water purification. A typical photovoltaic panel, when installed on
                                    farmland, casts a shadow and dramatically reduces plant growth and crop yield from
                                    the shadowed area.
                                </li>
                                <li>The <strong>new approach</strong> would instead use the same land mass for all three
                                    purposes simultaneously through innovative technologies that split the spectrum into
                                    three segments and efficiently harvest sunlight.
                                </li>
                                <li>The proposed photovoltaic designs transmit photons responsible for plant growth
                                    while reflecting remaining photons in the solar spectrum to specially designed solar
                                    cells that can help generate electricity and collect heat for energy recovery and
                                    water purification.

                                    International encourages national and State governments to recognise the areas as
                                    sites of vital importance for conservation of wildlife and to empower local

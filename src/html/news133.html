                <li>According to the SC’s decisions, recommendations on judicial appointments, elevations and transfers
                    will be posted on the court website
                </li>
                <li>As a start, the Supreme Court has posted online detailed reasons for its October 3, 2017
                    recommendations for judicial appointments to the Madras HC and the Kerala HC
                </li>
                <li>Details are now available online under the tag “<strong>Collegium Resolutions”</strong></li>

            <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Collegium system was being critcised for its opaque mode of functioning while recommending judicial
                    appointments
                </li>
                <li>Recently, a controversy came after the public uproar over the resignation of Karnataka HC judge
                    shortly after his transfer to the Allahabad HC
                </li>
                <li>The mode of functioning of the Collegium had seen criticism, for the first time, from within the
                    Collegium itself in the form of Justice Chelameswar
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Judges opinion</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Proposal to upload the Collegium recommendations indicating reasons had to face strong objections
                    from within the judicial community itself
                </li>
                <li>One of the objections include that posting such information online would cause judicial candidates
                    acute embarrassment and loss of face in case of rejection of their names by the Collegium

            <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Iran nuclear deal between Tehran and six world powers reached in 2015 appears to be in jeopardy
                    as President Donald Trump is unlikely to issue a certification mandated by a U.S law for the
                    country’s continuing participation in the agreement.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>In news:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The President of U.S. is expected to give a speech explaining his position and a new, tougher policy
                    towards Iran next week.
                </li>
                <li>The President’s view that Iran is not in compliance with the deal, also called the the Joint
                    Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), is at odds with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and
                    the other five signatories to the deal — Russia, China, France, Germany and U.K.
                </li>
                <li>The IAEA and these five countries maintain that Iran is in full compliance.</li>
                <li>Trump appears to be going by the advice of a segment of the Republican Party and two key American
                    allies in region, Israel and Saudi Arabia, both bitter opponents of the deal negotiated by the
                    Barack Obama administration.
                </li>
                <li>The deal has provisions to deal with an Iranian breach, but does not foresee an American
                    non-compliance.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Four points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015, the President is required to issue a
                    certification to Congress every 90 days that makes a determination on four points — that
                </li>
                <li>Iran is fully implementing the JCPOA</li>
                <li>Iran has not committed a material breach</li>
                <li>Iran has not taken any action that could significantly advance a nuclear weapons programme, and</li>
                <li>Suspension of sanctions is appropriate and proportionate to the measures taken by Iran and vital to
                    U.S. national security interests.<strong> </strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What next if the President denies the certification?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>When the President refuses to certify, the onus is on the U.S Congress to decide the course of
                    action.
                </li>
                <li>The Congress will get 60 days to decide whether or not to reimpose the sanctions on Iran, lifted as
                    part of the nuclear deal.
                </li>
                <li>For now, supporters of decertification argue that this move could open the path for a stronger deal
                    that could be negotiated.

            <ul>
                <li>The Goods and Services Tax Council allowed small companies to file quarterly returns instead of
                    monthly submissions.
                </li>
                <li>Council also expanded the scope of the Composition Scheme for paying GST and making it easier for
                    exporters to claim tax refund.
                </li>
                <li>The government also allowed small service providers to operate across multiple states without
                    registering with the GST Network.
                </li>
                <li>To ease transportation problems of small unregistered businesses, the Council exempted Goods
                    Transport Agencies from paying GST on services provided to an unregistered person.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Possible impact</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The decisions announced will ease compliance burden on nearly 90 percent of the tax assesses.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Composition Scheme</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Composition Scheme has been made available to taxpayers having annual aggregate turnover of up
                    to Rs 1 crore (previously 75 lakhs)
                </li>
                <li>This scheme is currently available to traders, manufacturers, and restaurants</li>

                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Digital Technologies and its importance for India</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Digital Technology has the potential to add economic value of $550 billion to $1 trillion per year
                    by 2025, and create millions of well-paying, productive jobs
                </li>
                <li>Digital leadership is effective for companies only when it creates value—for their customers,
                    partners and employees
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Issues:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The business process improvement strategy was often overlooked as the technology teams typically
                    jumped into operations deploying a set of digital tools
                </li>
                <li>This mindset is precisely what led to failed implementation and reduced business value in the past
                </li>
                <li>What is going wrong in solving this issue: Organisations, in their attempt to solve their problems,
                    have rushed to adopt various isolated technology components before defining the problem they were
                    trying to solve
                </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Today, the entire thought process has been changed</li>
                <li>Addressing design is now the first port of call in the new-age digital businesses that intelligently
                    connect people, things and business, to create a good experience for their customers
                </li>
                <li>The result is simultaneous growth in revenue and reduction in costs</li>
                <li>Retail chains are experiencing the impact when they turned its online sales platform into a unique
                    mobile experience
                </li>
                <li>And moved its infrastructure to the cloud, leveraging a digital platform that combined several
                    digital tools, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, blockchain and big data
                    analytics to create a better experience for its users
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Digital technologies and other areas:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Production at an agriculture farm can be monitored digitally, thereby allowing informed, intelligent
                    decisions that can prevent crop spoilage, increase efficiency with sustainability
                </li>
                <li>For large manufacturing companies, digital technology can empower the workforce to fix critical
                    problems in real time

                <li>Trends in global CO2 and total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions show that India’s emissions have gone
                    up by 4.7% in 2016
                </li>
                <li>For most major GHG emitters in the world, the emission figures have gone down, barring India and
                    Indonesia
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Other GHG emitters</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The report shows that emissions in the U.S. saw a fall of 2%, the Russian Federation 2.1%, Brazil
                    6.1%, China 0.3%, and, the United Kingdom 6.4%
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Non-CO2 emissions</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>In 2016, the five largest emitting countries and the European Union accounted for 68% of total
                    global CO2 emissions and about 63% of total global GHG emissions
                </li>
                <li>Most of the emissions consist of CO2, about 72%</li>
                <li>But methane , nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases also make up substantial shares of 19%, 6% and 3%,
                    respectively
                </li>
                <li>The combined share of non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions is about 28% in total GHG emissions, but it
                    varies for the largest countries:
                </li>
                <li>11% for Japan</li>

            <p><strong>Basic Information:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Greenhouse gas</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A greenhouse gas is a gas in an atmosphere that absorbs and emits radiation within the thermal
                    infrared range. This process is the fundamental cause of the greenhouse effect.
                </li>
                <li>The primary greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere are water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous
                    oxide, and ozone.
                </li>
                <li>Without greenhouse gases, the average temperature of Earth’s surface would be about −18 °C (0 °F),
                    rather than the present average of 15 °C (59 °F).
                </li>
                <li>In the Solar System, the atmospheres of Venus, Mars and Titan also contain gases that cause a
                    greenhouse effect.

            <ul>
                <li>Nearly 90 percent of the country’s coal-fired power generation capacity is in violation of Sulphur
                    Dioxide (SO2) emission limits notified two years ago.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Power ministry directive:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Power Ministry has asked the Environment Ministry to defer implementing the NOX emission limits by
                    three years (for coal-based units installed before December 2003).
                </li>
                <li>For units installed after December 2003, it has requested that it be allowed to operate them at
                    higher NOX emission limit of 600 mg/Nm3 (milligrams per cubic metre) for three years.
                </li>
                <li>This is because the state-run NTPC Ltd is currently conducting a “pilot study” to test if “NOX
                    control technology” will work for “Indian coal” that has “high ash content”.
                </li>
                <li>The Power Ministry stated that it will take seven years to “retro-fit” Flue Gas Desulphurisation
                    (FGD) systems — which remove SO2 from exhaust flue gases — in the existing capacity.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Effect of SO2 and NOX emissions</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Short-term exposures to SO2 can harm the human respiratory system and make breathing difficult.</li>
                <li>Children, the elderly, and those who suffer from asthma are particularly sensitive to effects of
                    SO2.
                </li>
                <li>NOX, too, can trigger “serious respiratory problems”.</li>
                <li>Both SO2 and NOX can be easily oxidised within airborne water droplets to form acid precipitation or
                    ‘acid rain’.

            <ul>
                <li>The Home Ministry will move a Cabinet note to construct seven <strong>integrated check-posts (ICPs)
                    along the Bangladesh border</strong> to give a fillip to trade and business with the neighbouring
                    country.
                </li>
                <li>In all, 13 such check-posts have been planned, seven of them along the Bangladesh border.</li>
                <li><strong>Key Fact:</strong> The project was envisaged in 2007. A separate body — <strong>the Land
                    Port Authority of India (LPAI)</strong> — was constituted in 2011 to boost trade via the land border
                    points.
                </li>
                <li>Eventually, 19 ICPs are expected to come up along the Bangladesh border. Besides the seven in West
                    Bengal, three will be in Assam, two in Meghalaya and seven in Tripura.
                </li>
                <li>An ICP has several facilities such as passenger terminal building, currency exchange counter,
                    Internet hubs, cargo process building, cargo inspection sheds, warehouse, cold storage, quarantine
                    laboratory, clearing agents, banks, vehicle scanners, isolation bay, parking and cafeteria.
                </li>
                <li>ICPs help put in place a system to secure the country’s borders against hostile elements. It also
                    facilitates trade and commerce and boosts revenue.

                    said: The Rohingya refugee crisis is worse than the exodus from Syria.
                </li>
                <li>The Rohingya exodus from southwest Myanmar to southeast Bangladesh is man-made and needs a political
                    solution.
                </li>
                <li>He said the international community should treat the refugee influx as “a top priority” so that the
                    problem was resolved quickly and refugees were able to go back to their country.

            <p><strong>In news:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Iranian Ambassador said that U.S. was trying to ensure that India reduced oil imports from his
                    country
                </li>
                <li>It is working to deprive Tehran of the Indian energy market</li>
                <li>This is after the U.S. announcement of a tougher line on Iran, even imposition of possible new

                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>India has cut its oil imports from Iran by approximately 20% in 2017, though its global imports have
                    risen by 5.4%
                </li>
                <li>The Petroleum Ministry says India has been trying to “diversify” its imports so as to get more
                    competitive rates
                </li>
                <li>One major development is India’s decision to import its first shipment of crude oil from the U.S.,
                    giving rise to speculation that New Delhi’s new policy will come at the cost of imports from Iran

            <p><strong>Effect on India-Iran relations</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>He said that U.S. President Donald Trump’s policy shift would not affect the India-Iran

                </li>
                <li>Development of the Chabahar port project will remain on track</li>

                </li>
                <li>India committed about $1.6 billion to build the <strong>Chabahar-Zahedan</strong> railway line,

            </ul>
            <p><strong>Speculations:</strong>       </p>
            <ul>
                <li>India’s relations with Pakistan and China have entered a difficult phase has also generated
                    apprehensions in India about the forum creating new pressures on Jammu and Kashmir
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>SCO’s objective and India’s expectations:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Countering extremism, terrorism and separatism is a major objective of the SCO</li>
                <li>Sceptics would say the apparent convergence between what the SCO does and India wants may be
                    somewhat deceptive
                </li>
                <li>They would insist that the difficulties encountered by the recent Indian bid to isolate Pakistan in
                    various international forums should caution India against expecting too much on this front at the
                    SCO
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What India should do?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>India must persist in the belief that change is inevitable and purposeful diplomacy can allow India
                    to probe for new opportunities for regional security cooperation
                </li>
                <li>The recent kidnapping and killing of two Chinese nationals in Pakistan underlines the prospect that
                    Beijing can’t forever remain untouched by the terror nurtured by Pakistan
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Belt and road initiative issues:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Differences between China’s President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi could not be
                    masked
                </li>
                <li>If Xi argued that the SCO could become a major vehicle for its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative,
                    Modi articulated India’s reservations, especially the impact of the project on India’s sovereignty
                    in Kashmir
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Effective steps by the Indian PM</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The PM appears to have found the right balance between articulating India’s concerns and underlining
                    India’s promise to strengthen inner Asian regionalism
                </li>
                <li>He outlined a realistic approach towards the SCO that combined a strong emphasis on countering
                    terrorism and a readiness to explore win-win solutions for expanding connectivity

            <p><strong>Context</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Centre is taking steps for greater formalization of the gold trade with an eye on the future.
                </li>
                <li>In accordance with these steps, the country unveiled its first commodity options trading in the gold
                    on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX).
                </li>
                <li>The gold option contract, with gold (1 kg) futures as underlying, expiring on November 28, 2017 and
                    January 29, 2018 were made available for trading yesterday.
                </li>
                <li>As an introductory measure, no transaction fee is being charged on this product till December.</li>
                <li>This marks an important evolution in the trading of the yellow metal itself.</li>
                <li>Options trading hedge all risks for those dealing in gold.</li>
                <li>Given that Indians were big buyers of gold there are expectations that the new product would be
                    extremely successful and with appropriate policy measures it will help formalize the gold trade.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Benefits to the consumers:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>They are in consonance with the business environment for the future, the more it formalises, the
                    better it is for consumers, jewellers and traders.
                </li>
                <li>The European-styled gold options are hedger-friendly and physically settled, which means on exercise
                    at expiration, the options position develops into corresponding underlying MCX one kilogram gold
                    futures position at the strike price of the exercised options.
                </li>
                <li>By hedging risk of rise in gold prices using ‘Gold Call Options Contract,’ a jeweller would not only
                    be protected against price rise, but also would benefit from fall in gold prices.
                </li>
                <li>Similarly by hedging risk of fall in gold prices using a ‘Gold Put Options Contract’, a jeweller
                    would not only be protected against price fall, but would benefit from rise in gold prices.
                </li>
                <li>Gold is the first product for options trading that SEBI had permitted after modern commodity
                    derivatives trading started 14 years ago.
                </li>
                <li>The Finance Ministry had set up a committee for suggesting measures to transform India’s gold
                    market.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>SEBI and the integration of commodity markets</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>There has been a very conscious effort by the government and SEBI to develop and integrate commodity
                    markets in a phased manner.
                </li>
                <li>The introduction of options gives a strong impetus towards systematic development and transformation
                    of commodity derivatives market in India, ushering in a new era in price risk management in response
                    to stakeholder expectations.
                </li>
                <li>To further strengthen the market, a panel had been constituted in NITI Aayog to integrate spot and
                    derivative market.
                </li>
                <li>The gold option is as an extremely low-cost product.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Options Trading in other commodities</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>As per the SEBI rule, options trade is allowed in a commodity which has certain volumes in futures
                    trade.
                </li>
                <li>Around 7-8 commodities like cotton, CPO, crude, silver, zinc and copper are there which also
                    qualifies and after 3-6 months a decision will be taken to introduce options trading in them.

                <li>The <strong>Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana</strong> will replace government procurement with compensatory
                    payments
                </li>
                <li>This will be when market prices are below the MSP</li>
                <li>It is being implemented as a pilot scheme for eight crops</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Hope from the scheme</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The hope is that this will sidestep the implementation shortcomings of the procurement system</li>
                <li>These extend from the lack of government storage facilities and supply chain logistics</li>
                <li>Also, the fact that despite the government declaring MSPs for 25 crops, it largely procures only
                    rice and wheat
                </li>
                <li>It will be less distortionary, freeing up space for the market to set rates</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Reality check</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The knowledge that the government will make up the shortfall will incentivize traders to set rates
                    well below the MSP
                </li>
                <li>The scheme has a two-month window, which means that the rush to sell in that period will also push
                    prices down
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Need for government intervention</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The agricultural sector is one of the handful where inelastic demand for the products, the
                    deleterious public effects of supply shocks and inherent risks for suppliers mandate a government
                    role
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Agricultural reforms: What is needed?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Truly transformative agricultural reforms will require work on three levels</strong></p>
            <p><strong>The first level is mandi system</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>With the 2003 and 2017 versions of the model Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act,
                    governments have attempted to liberalize this system, providing for private markets and integrated
                    state markets
                </li>
                <li>This was a step towards a national market facilitated by the National Agriculture Market (eNAM)</li>
                <li>The problem with this is that it still operates within the mandi system</li>
                <li>Solution: Government needs to get out of the business altogether—and that is only possible with a
                    switch from the public distribution system to direct benefit transfers
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The second level of reforms should be aimed at inputs</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana aims to extend irrigation cover to all forms and maximize
                    water-use efficiency over a period of five years
                </li>
                <li>In a water-stressed yet groundwater-dependent country like India, this is only possible with
                    comprehensive rural electrification, allowing for techniques such as drip irrigation
                </li>
                <li>The other major reform needed here is access to formal credit</li>
                <li>The current dependence on informal credit leaves farmers beholden to middlemen and traders who are
                    often the credit suppliers, thus undercutting the former’s bargaining power
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The third level of reforms should be reduction in number of people participating in
                Agriculture</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>As per the last Agriculture Census, the average farm holding in India is a minuscule 1.15 hectares
                </li>
                <li>Their number has been on the rise since the 1970s and is expected to touch 91% by 2030</li>
                <li>There is no feasible way to make such a fragmented agricultural economy workable</li>
                <li>For a sustainably healthy agricultural economy, the number of people participating in it must be
                    drastically reduced
                </li>
                <li>Measures such as enabling large-scale contract farming and corporate farming will help here—but the
                    only genuine solution is job creation in non-agricultural sectors
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The sawfish, included in <strong>Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972</strong>
                    enacted to save them from exploitation, have been sighted off the Indian coast less than 10 times in
                    over a decade and they appear to be more threatened than tigers and elephants.
                </li>
                <li>A statement issued by the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute said the sawfish may be the
                    most endangered fish species in India.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Only five species</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>There are only five species of the sawfish ever identified — dwarf sawfish, knifetooth sawfish,
                    smalltooth sawfish, largetooth sawfish and green sawfish.
                </li>
                <li>Sawfish are elasmobranchs, meaning their skeleton is made of cartilage. They are closely related to
                    sharks and have shark-shaped bodies and, hence, are also called flat sharks.
                </li>

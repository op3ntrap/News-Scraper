                <ul>
                    <li>A “mentally-retarded” adult cannot be considered a child and given refuge under the <strong>Protection
                        of Children from Sexual Offences Act of 2012</strong>, the Supreme Court held.
                    </li>
                    <li>The case before the court was that of a rape victim, whose biological age is 38 though medical
                        reports conclude that her “mental age” is that of six-year-old.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Biological age</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The petitioner said the biological age of a person should not be the governing yardstick for
                        POCSO, which seeks to protect children from sexual abuse.
                    </li>
                    <li>Treat them with fragility and provide them gentle care throughout the criminal trial and swiftly
                        punish the guilty.
                    </li>
                    <li>Any person, even an adult, who is incapable of understanding what is happening to her, is equal
                        to a child.
                    </li>
                    <li>A holistic interpretation of the term ‘child’ to include intellectually-vulnerable adults serves
                        the basic purpose of the 2012 Act.
                    </li>

                <p><strong>SC Judgement</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In separate judgments, agreed that a judge cannot take on the role of the legislator.</li>
                    <li>It is not for the judge to decide “what the law ought to be instead of what the law is”.</li>
                    <li>Definition of the term ‘child’ in Section 2(d) is exhaustive and includes only persons below the
                        biological age of 18.
                    </li>
                    <li>The 2012 Act recognises the phenomenon of “mental disability,” but confines its ambit to only
                        the mental disability of minors.

                        </li>
                        <li>The WCO is impressed by the fact that as many as 51 of the 76 activities mentioned in the
                            NTFAP “go beyond” the implementation requirements of the World Trade Organisation’s Trade

                        <li>Free global flow of data is wrongly presented as being the same as the free flow of

                    <p><strong>Nature of digital intelligence</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>First, digital intelligence is going to be by far the single most important economic
                            resource
                        </li>
                        <li>Whoever has it controls everything</li>
                        <li>Second, digital intelligence tends to concentrate strongly around a few poles or centres
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Effects of digital intelligence on future world</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The nature of digital intelligence will results in every sector getting organised around a
                            very few centres of sectoral digital intelligence
                        </li>
                        <li>Countries will be forced to negotiate with countries which supplies most of their A.I.
                            software, for example, China or the United States
                        </li>
                        <li>Why: to essentially become that country’s economic dependent</li>
                        <li>How: by taking in welfare subsidies in exchange for letting the “parent” nation’s A.I.
                            companies continue to profit from the dependent country’s users
                        </li>
                        <li>Such economic arrangements would reshape today’s geopolitical alliances</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Digital Industrialisation in India</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>India must consider a digital industrialisation strategy</li>
                        <li><strong>Why:</strong> to ensure that digitally-induced efficiencies in every sector to be
                            retained within India and not allowed to flow out without any obstruction
                        </li>
                        <li>This will not only ensure that our economy and society are not controlled from outside but
                            also protect existing jobs and create many more new ones
                        </li>
                        <li>But if it allows such outflows, it will soon find itself on the wrong side of digital
                            colonisation
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Requirements for starting a Digital Industrialisation in India</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This requires an independent digital policy, including protections for India’s digital
                            industry
                        </li>

                            Bengal tiger, but far less known.
                        </li>
                        <li>Batagur baska, the 60-cm-long turtle that is presumed extinct in several Southeast Asian
                            countries, is classified as critically endangered by the International Union for
                            Conservation of Nature ( IUCN) in its Red List of threatened species. The tiger, by
                            comparison, is endangered.
                        </li>
                        <li>Batagur baska is described as the world’s second most endangered turtle.</li>

                            freshwater turtle.

                            kachuga (Red-crowned roofed turtle) and Batagur dhongoka (Three-striped roofed turtle) are
                            found in the tributaries of the Ganga, such as Chambal.

                                <li>An international team led by scientists from Johns Hopkins University has, for the
                                    first time, found what causes the spread of cancer and what could slow it down.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Important findings:</strong></li>
                                <li>90% of cancer deaths are caused when cancer cells break off from the origin and
                                    start spreading elsewhere in the body.
                                </li>
                                <li>There are no existing drugs for stopping this spread, known as metastasis, of
                                    cancer.
                                </li>
                                <li>No commercial drugs are now being produced specifically to inhibit metastasis
                                    because drug companies believe the best way to stop cancer from spreading is to
                                    destroy the primary tumor from which it originates.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Findings:</strong></li>
                                <li>When cancer cells get densely packed they secrete two proteins that deliver a stark
                                    message to other cells: go away. This causes the cancer cells to break off from the
                                    pack and float through the blood stream or lymphatic system to other sites and start
                                    growing afresh.
                                </li>
                                <li>The team found that two existing drugs — Tocilizumab and Reparaxin — prevented
                                    cancer cells from getting their marching orders.
                                </li>
                                <li>Tocilizumab is an approved medication for rheumatoid arthritis and is in trials for
                                    use in ovarian cancer cases. Reparaxin is being evaluated as a possible treatment
                                    for breast cancer.

                                    Latest technologies for extraction of metals from the minerals have also been
                                    developed under the programme. Detailed environmental data has been collected for

                                                Chandi Puja or worship of land. This festival is marked with the
                                                performing of puja where prayers are offered to the Supreme Power for
                                                Peace and Protection and for the well-being of all the living and
                                                non-living things of the universe. Apart from this, Buddha Purnima is
                                                also celebrated in Sikkim as the day marked the birth of Gautam Buddha

                        body</strong> under the<strong> Ministry of Information and Broadcasting</strong>.
                    </li>
                    <li>It is tasked with “regulating the public exhibition of films under the provisions of the
                        <strong>Cinematograph Act 1952</strong>“.
                    </li>

                    <li>There are a <strong>total of nine regional offices</strong> for the CBFC which includes Mumbai,
                        Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Thiruvananthapuram, Hyderabad, New Delhi, Cuttack and Guwahati.
                    </li>
                    <li>The body’s primary function is to assign each film to one of the four categories –
                        <ul>
                            <li>U – Unrestricted public exhibition</li>

                        after they are certified by the Board, including films shown on television.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Board is considered to be one of the <strong>strictest Censor Boards in the world</strong>.
                        One of the most notable guidelines of the Board include: “any scenes which intend to degrade or

                        as an autonomous and self-sustained premier testing organization to conduct entrance
                        examinations for higher educational institutions
                    </li>
                    <li>The entrance examinations will be conducted in online mode at least twice a year, thereby giving

                        of daily items of consumption, relaxed penalties and tweaked rules to make it easier for
                        businesses, especially small and medium enterprises, to comply.
                    </li>
                    <li>The biggest rationalization was the decision to cut the tax rate on 178 items from 28% to 18%,
                        leaving only 50 items in the highest tax slab and offering major relief to consumers and

                    <li>It comes into effect from 15 November, is likely to boost consumer demand, reduce disquiet over
                        compliance costs and also lend fresh momentum to the tax reform initiative.

                    <li>The Aam Aadmi Party government on Friday announced free bus rides aboard its Delhi Transport
                        Corporation fleet from November 13 to 17, the proposed dates of odd-even car rationing scheme,
                        even as the National Green Tribunal questioned the rationale
                    </li>
                    <li>According to sources, the free rides are expected to cause a loss of around Rs. 9.5 crore to the
                        cash-strapped public transporter.
                    </li>
                    <li>The government’s decision of free bus rides is subject to the NGT’s final call on the odd-even
                        scheme.
                    </li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, the DTC will operate 500 additional buses under its ‘Paryavaran Seva’, with half
                        their seats reserved for women.

                        ballistic missile submarine that would carry nuclear missiles. INS Chakra has been taken on
                        lease from Russia for 10 years to provide the Navy the opportunity to train personnel and
                        operate such nuclear-powered vessels. India is already engaged in negotiations for the second
                        nuclear submarine from Russia, which could join service when INS Chakra returns after its
                        10-year lease.</p></div>

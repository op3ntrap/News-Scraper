                        <li>BRICS is the acronym for an association of five major emerging national economies: <strong>Brazil,
                            Russia, India, China and South Africa</strong>.
                        </li>
                        <li>Originally the first four were grouped as “BRIC” (or “the BRICs”), before the induction of
                            South Africa in 2010.
                        </li>
                        <li>The BRICS members are all leading <strong>developing or newly industrialized
                            countries</strong>, but they are distinguished by their large, sometimes fast-growing
                            economies and significant influence on regional affairs; all five are G-20 members.
                        </li>
                        <li>The term does not include countries such as South Korea, Mexico and Turkey for which other
                            acronyms and group associations were later created.

                    <p><strong>Financial structure: </strong>Currently, there are two components that make up the
                        financial architecture of BRICS, namely, the <strong>New Development Bank (NDB)</strong> and the
                        <strong>Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA)</strong>. Both of these components were signed into
                        treaty in 2014 and became active in 2015.</p>
                    <p><strong>a. New Development Bank:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The New Development Bank (NDB) is based in Shanghai.</li>
                        <li>The New Development Bank (NDB), formerly referred to as the BRICS Development Bank, is a
                            <strong>multilateral development bank</strong> operated by the BRICS states.
                        </li>
                        <li>The bank’s primary focus of lending will be <strong>infrastructure projects</strong> with
                            authorized lending of up to $34 billion annually.
                        </li>
                        <li>South Africa will be the African Headquarters of the Bank named the “New Development Bank
                            Africa Regional Centre”.
                        </li>
                        <li>The bank will have starting capital of $50 billion, with capital increased to $100 billion
                            over time.
                        </li>
                        <li>Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa will initially contribute $10 billion each to
                            bring the total to $50 billion.

                    <ul>
                        <li>The BRICS <strong>Contingent Reserve Arrangement</strong> (CRA) is a framework for providing
                            protection against <strong>global liquidity pressures</strong>.
                        </li>
                        <li>This includes currency issues where members’ national currencies are being adversely
                            affected by global financial pressures.
                        </li>
                        <li>It is found that emerging economies that experienced rapid economic liberalization went
                            through increased economic volatility, bringing uncertain macroeconomic environment.
                        </li>
                        <li>The CRA is generally seen as a competitor to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and along
                            with the New Development Bank is viewed as an example of increasing South-South cooperation.
                        </li>
                        <li>It was established in 2015 by the BRICS countries Brazil, Russia, India, China and South
                            Africa.
                        </li>

                <li>World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business (2016) Ranking positioned India at a abysmal 130 out of 150
                    countries.
                </li>
                <li>A survey by the Niti Aayog and the Mumbai-based think tank, IDFC Institute, post a year disclose
                    that the determinations of the Centre and state governments to ease the system of permits and
                    clearances could not satisfy the interests of most entrepreneurs who are discomforted with the
                    country’s regulatory environment.
                </li>
                <li>The survey across the country demonstrates that most firms do not use the single-window systems for
                    business and regulatory clearances.
                </li>
                <li>Survey claims Tamil Nadu,the best performing states where the process takes more than 60 days and on
                    average four months to set up a business in India.
                </li>
                <li>Persistent drawbacks with governance in India are seen as the reason behind the gap between the
                    claims and realities.
                </li>
                <li>The difficulty of cutting the red tape of the lower bureaucracy is one of the major hurdles in the
                    process.
                </li>
                <li>The World Bank’s report (2016), highlighted that delays in issuing construction permits affected the
                    ease of doing business in India.
                </li>
                <li>A key worry to the administrators come in as entrepreneurs from employment-intensive sectors are
                    more likely to face problems and securing construction and other permits, compared to the
                    capital-intensive ones.
                </li>
                <li>The survey should serve as a wake-up call to government and a reminder that over two decades after
                    economic reforms the Indian state is still flailing when it comes to easing the path for
                    entrepreneurs.

            <p><strong>In news:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Proposed bill will not fix a single national level minimum wage for the whole country, but will vary
                    across states and geographies.
                </li>
                <li>Code on Wages Bill 2017: “It provides for national minimum wage for different geographical areas so
                    as to ensure that no State Government fixes the minimum wage below the national minimum wage,
                    notified for that area by the Central Government,”
                </li>
                <li>The Centre will fix different wages through a notification after consulting the Central Advisory
                    Board.
                </li>
                <li>As per the new provisions of the bill- if the minimum wages fixed by the states are <strong>already
                    higher</strong> than the ‘national minimum wage’, the states will <strong>not be allowed to lower
                    their wage levels</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>The Code on Wages Bill combines four labour laws — Payment of Wages Act, 1936, Minimum Wages Act,
                    1948, Payment of Bonus Act, 1965 and Equal Remuneration Act, 1976.

                        <li><strong>Geo-fencing</strong> is a feature in a software program that uses the <strong>global
                            positioning system</strong> (GPS) or <strong>radio frequency identification (RFID)</strong>
                            to define geographical boundaries.<br/> Geo-fencing allow an administrator to set up
                            triggers so when a device enters (or exits) the boundaries defined by the administrator, an
                            alert is issued. Many geo-fencing applications incorporate Google Earth, allowing
                            administrators to define boundaries on top of a satellite view of a specific geographical
                            area.  Other applications define boundaries by longitude and latitude or through
                            user-created and Web-based maps.

                <li>The blockade impact can be on the disruption of trade and transport links between the Northeast and
                    the rest of India.
                </li>
                <li>This region is already facing the burnt of the seasonal floods in the Brahmaputra basin.</li>
                <li>Both these instances together can result in severe economic costs to this region.</li>
                <li>Tea and tourism, which are lifelines of the local economy, have almost crumpled.</li>
                <li>Well-timed state involvement handled with patience and wisdom may prevent these agitations from

                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Reason behind the demand:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>At the roots of these protests lies in the communal identity and their representation. The Gorkhas
                    in the Darjeeling hills and the Bodos in upper Assam believe that a separate state is necessary to
                    protect their collective social, cultural and political identities including language and ethnicity.
                </li>
                <li>The seeds of separatist politics now churning the region are the result of the constitution of
                    states like Bengal and Assam.
                </li>
                <li>The majority or dominant groups established their linguistic and ethnic identity without giving much
                    attention towards the minorities, who were then in the margins of the region’s politics.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Way forward:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The run of identity politics needs to be destroyed, where the autonomous bodies can play a prominent
                    role.
                </li>
                <li>Gorkhaland Territorial Administration and Bodo Autonomous Council are valuable tools in delivering
                    the public goods and build physical and social infrastructure. However, the unfinished and
                    unsatisfying work of politics in these states may not fully satisfy the aspirations of these groups.

                    of the people living in the area.
                </li>
                <li>The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) submitted a report to the Union Ministry of Environment,
                    Forests and Climate Change, which resulted in setting up an expert committee by the state
                    government.
                </li>
                <li>The report highlights the sustained inflow of untreated sewage and industrial effluents as the
                    principal forces behind the phenomena of froth and fire.
                </li>
                <li>The Silicon Valley of India, which has been known for its hundreds of lakes originally built in the
                    16th century by damming the natural valley systems is threatened with pollution today.
                </li>
                <li>The National Green Tribunal has issued a number of directions emphasising the need for removal of
                    silt from the lake, treatment of municipal sewage which is going into the water body, closure of
                    polluting industries, ban on dumping of municipal solid waste around the lake, penalty on apartment
                    buildings in the area which are sending untreated sewage to the lake and an environmental fine of Rs
                    5 lakh on anyone found dumping waste in and around the lake.
                </li>
                <li>The untreated wastewater or sewage of local waterbodies feeds the growth of water-weeds, which
                    blankets surface water.
                </li>
                <li>Apparently, the huge roots of water hyacinth absorb impurities and can lock up pollutants in the
                    water.
                </li>
                <li>The microbes feeding on the rotting organic matter consume all the oxygen in the water, disturbing
                    the ecology for the survival of fish life.
                </li>
                <li>When such organic matter naturally breaks down, it releases fatty acids that float to the surface.
                    This is how foam is formed and turns into froth.
                </li>
                <li>The phosphorus content in the detergents in India is much higher than 2.2 per cent, which
                    contributes to the formation of these weeds.
                </li>
                <li>Urban planning in India must ensure that wetlands which are natural recharge zones are typically not
                    disturbed
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Facts:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Out of 480 million litres per day (MLD) of wastewater discharged to the lake, only 308 MLD is
                    treated.
                </li>
                <li>According to the CPCB, 75 per cent of the measured pollution in our rivers from point sources is
                    from municipal sewage and 25 per cent is from industrial effluents.

                    <li>The Sargasso Sea is a region of the North Atlantic Ocean bounded by four currents forming an
                        ocean gyre. Unlike all other regions called seas, it has no land boundaries. <strong>It is
                            distinguished from other parts of the Atlantic Ocean by its characteristic brown Sargassum
                            seaweed and often calm blue water.</strong></li>
                    <li>The sea is bounded on the west by the Gulf Stream, on the north by the North Atlantic Current,
                        on the east by the Canary Current, and on the south by the North Atlantic Equatorial Current, a
                        clockwise-circulating system of ocean currents termed the North Atlantic Gyre.
                    </li>
                    <li>It lies between 70º and 40º W, and 20º to 35º N, and is approximately 1,100 km wide by 3,200 km
                        long (700 by 2,000 statute miles).[5][6] Bermuda is near the western fringes of the sea.
                    </li>
                    <li>All the currents deposit the marine plants and refuse they carry into this sea, yet the ocean
                        water in the Sargasso Sea is distinctive for its deep blue color and exceptional clarity, with
                        underwater visibility of up to 61 m (200 ft).It is also a body of water that has captured the
                        public imagination, and so is seen in a wide variety of literary and artistic works and in
                        popular culture.

                <p>Topic: General Science<br/> Level: Difficult</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>The presence of elevated levels of arsenic in groundwater has become a major concern around the
                    world, especially in South Asia. Up to date, there is no effective treatment for curing health
                    impacts due to the intake of high levels of arsenic. <strong>A wide range of technologies has been
                        developed for the removal of high concentrations of arsenic from drinking water. The most common
                        arsenic removal technologies use oxidation, coagulation, precipitation adsorption, ion exchange
                        and membrane techniques</strong>. Other potential approaches would include phytoremediation or
                    the use of bacteria, which can play an important role in catalysing biological arsenic removal
                    processes. All the arsenic treatment technologies ultimately concentrate arsenic in the sorption
                    media, the residual sludge or in a liquid media. To avoid indiscriminate disposal and environmental
                    pollution, these wastes need to be treated or disposed of properly.</p></div>

                <p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Keoladeo National Park</strong></p>
                <p>This former duck-hunting reserve of the Maharajas is one of the major wintering areas for large
                    numbers of aquatic birds from Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, China and Siberia. Some 364 species of
                    birds, including the rare Siberian crane, have been recorded in the park.</p>
                <p><strong>Group of Monuments at Hampi</strong></p>
                <p>The austere, grandiose site of Hampi was the last capital of the last great Hindu Kingdom of
                    Vijayanagar. Its fabulously rich princes built Dravidian temples and palaces which won the
                    admiration of travellers between the 14th and 16th centuries. Conquered by the Deccan Muslim
                    confederacy in 1565, the city was pillaged over a period of six months before being abandoned.</p>
                <p><strong>Nanda Devi and Valley of Flowers National Parks</strong></p>
                <p>Nestled high in West Himalaya, India’s Valley of Flowers National Park is renowned for its meadows of
                    endemic alpine flowers and outstanding natural beauty. This richly diverse area is also home to rare
                    and endangered animals, including the Asiatic black bear, snow leopard, brown bear and blue sheep.
                    The gentle landscape of the Valley of Flowers National Park complements the rugged mountain
                    wilderness of Nanda Devi National Park. Together they encompass a unique transition zone between the
                    mountain ranges of the Zanskar and Great Himalaya, praised by mountaineers and botanists for over a
                    century and in Hindu mythology for much longer.</p>
                <p><strong>Sundarbans National Park</strong></p>
                <p>The Sundarbans covers 10,000 km2 of land and water (more than half of it in India, the rest in
                    Bangladesh) in the Ganges delta. It contains the world’s largest area of mangrove forests. A number
                    of rare or endangered species live in the park, including tigers, aquatic mammals, birds and
                    reptiles.</p></div>

        <p>You are stranded in traffic in your car. You are driving the car. A poor girl looking very frail approaches
            you and start begging for money. Looking at her frail appearance, out of compassion, you take out your
            wallet to search for a ten Rupees note. The girl who is standing very near to you snatches the wallet
            and starts running. A man on a motorbike who see this act, catches the girl and starts beating her in full
            view of public. Now the traffic is moving and your car is in the middle of the road.<br/>What will you do in
            such a situation? Explain the course of action and reason?</p>

            <li>Call to destination where I was heading about the emergency so that they will not wait for me.</li>
            <li>Reach the spot where the man is beating girl and immediately stop him and ask him not to beat or take
                law in his hand. Thank him for taking notice of the theft and taking action, but remind him that the
                girl is very young and could have acted out of hunger too. Remind him gently that it is a public space
                and such act physical violence could land him in legal trouble. This should lower his anger.
            </li>
            <li>If girl is injured- carry out first aid from the box available in the car. Get her something to eat and
                drink.
            </li>
            <li>Try to know her history and then informing to NGO or child care centre and personally taking to there
                will be my choice since leaving her just like that will make her to repeat the act since it’s the
                poverty and poor care made her to act. If these are given girl will desist from such acts.
            </li>
            <li>Make an occasional follow up of the girl with the agency to whom she had been handed over to.</li>

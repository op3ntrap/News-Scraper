            <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Recently, the Supreme Court decided to make public, on the court’s website, its various decisions,
                    including its verdicts on persons nominated for elevation as judges to the high courts, its choices
                    of candidates for elevation to the Supreme Court, and its decisions on transfer of judges between
                    different high courts
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Case Histories:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>In the cases <strong>of A. Zakir Hussain and Dr. K. Arul</strong>(candidates nominated for elevation
                    to the Madras High Court) the collegium has said: “keeping in view the material on record, including
                    the report of Intelligence Bureau [IB] he is not found suitable for elevation to the HC Bench”
                </li>
                <li>The reasons offered for rebuffing the nomination of <strong>Vasudevan V.N</strong>., a judicial
                    member of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, are particularly perplexing. The report said: “While
                    one of the two consultee-colleagues has offered no views about his suitability, the other colleague
                    has not found him suitable for elevation”
                </li>
                <li>As per record, his name was also recommended by the Collegium of the Calcutta High Court on
                    28.11.2016 and the Government of West Bengal has expressed its disagreement
                </li>
                <li>Record placed before us also shows that the proposal for his elevation initiated on a previous
                    occasion by the Collegium of the Bombay High Court was rejected by the Supreme Court Collegium on
                    1st August 2013
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Issues related to Vasudevan VN</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The collegium, ever since its inception, following the Supreme Court’s judgment in what is known as
                    the Second Judges Case (1993). The present revelations, much opposed to their perceived objective,
                    scarcely make the system more transparent
                </li>
                <li>In Mr. Vasudevan’s case, for example, we don’t know which of the “consultee-judges objected to his
                    elevation, and why the judge interviewed found him unsuitable
                </li>
                <li>Also the collegium’s express noting that Mr. Vasudevan had previously been recommended by two
                    different high court collegia
                </li>
                <li>These issues concerning the system employed to appoint judges to the Supreme Court and the high
                    courts are of particular salience
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Constitution of India and appointments of High Court judges:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The President, who would act on the advice of the council of ministers is required to compulsorily
                    consult certain authorities, including the Chief Justice of India (CJI)
                </li>
                <li>And when making appointments to a high court, the chief justice of that court</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong> ‘Consultation’:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>In 1977, in Sankalchand Sheth’s case, when interpreting the word “consultation,” the Supreme Court
                    ruled that the term can never mean “concurrence”. Hence, the CJI’s opinion, the court ruled, was not
                    binding on the executive
                </li>
                <li>And in 1981, in the First Judges Case, the court once again endorsed this interpretation, partly
                </li>
                <li>But twelve years later, in the Second Judges Case, the court overruled its earlier decisions. It now
                    held that “consultation” really meant “concurrence”. And that the CJI’s view enjoys primacy, since
                    he is “best equipped to know and assess the worth” of candidates
                </li>
                <li>In 1998, in the Third Judges Case, the court clarified its position further. The collegium, it said,
                    will comprise, in the case of appointments to the SC, the CJI and his four senior-most colleagues.
                    And, in the case of appointments to the high courts, the CJI and his two senior-most colleagues
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Collegium is a part of the basic structure of the constitution</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>When the Constitution was altered, through the <strong>99th constitutional amendment </strong>and
                    when the collegium was sought to be replaced by the <strong>National Judicial Appointments
                        Commission</strong>, the court swiftly struck it down
                </li>
                <li>It ruled, in what we might now call the <strong>Fourth Judges Case</strong> (2015), that the primacy
                    of the collegium was a part of the Constitution’s basic structure and this power could not,
                    therefore, be removed even through a constitutional amendment
                </li>

            <p><strong>World Health Organisation report regarding TB cases in India:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>India’s domestic budget for fighting tuberculosis showed a dramatic jump from about ₹700 crore in
                    2015 to ₹2,500 crore last year.
                </li>
                <li>In 2016, India recorded a 12% dip in the number of TB deaths from the previous year though the
                    incidence dipped marginally by 1%.
                </li>
                <li>The number of notified cases of drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) jumped from 79,000 to 84,000 in
                    2016
                </li>
                <li>However, with 1.7 million new cases in 2016, India still continues to be the largest contributor to
                    the global burden with up to a quarter of the 6.3 million new cases of TB (up from 6.1 million in
                    2015). Inspite of the dip, India accounts for about 32% of the number of people worldwide who
                    succumbed to the disease.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>‘90-90-90 target’ by 2035:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The government has committed to achieve a ‘<strong>90-90-90 target’ by 2035</strong> (90% reductions
                    in incidence, mortality and catastrophic health expenditures due to TB).
                </li>
                <li>This is premised on improved diagnostics, shorter treatment courses, a better vaccine and
                    comprehensive preventive strategies.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Activist opinions:</strong></p>
            <p>TB is still stigmatized and under-reported — especially from the private sector — and top-line drugs are
                still inadequate to treat people who suffer from the drug-resistant forms of the disease.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The Union government is working to conclude the sale of national carrier Air India by June 2018 and
                    is keen on selling its core airline operations, together with its low-cost international airline,
                    Air India Express.
                </li>
                <li>The decision was taken by the <strong>Air India-specific Alternative Mechanism</strong> — a group of
                    Ministers led by Finance Minister to decide on the modalities of stake sale in the national carrier.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Modalities:</strong> As per the decision, the Centre will look to sell AI’s regional airline
                    Alliance Air to a separate universe of bidders while Air India and Air India Express will likely go
                    together.
                </li>
                <li>On June 28, the <strong>Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs</strong>, chaired by Prime Minister
                    Narendra Modi, gave an in-principle nod for strategic disinvestment of Air India. The ministerial
                    panel, led by Finance minister, is aiming to divest stake in Air India and its subsidiaries by June
                    2018.
                </li>
                <li>The panel is also in favour of hiving off Air India’s properties and non-operational assets into a
                    special purpose vehicle (SPV) to retire a portion of the national carrier’s debt.

                    looking at raising funds through <strong>Initial Coin Offerings</strong> (ICO).
                </li>
                <li>The trend has caught the attention of the capital market regulator, which is evaluating whether such
                    instruments and offerings can be brought under its regulatory purview.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>In news:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)</strong> is mulling whether an ICO can be
                    regulated under the existing legal framework or certain amendments would be required in case the
                    government wants the capital market watchdog to be the regulatory authority for such issuances.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Who should regulate?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Incidentally, crypto currencies like bitcoin, ethereum and such offerings have been under government
                    radar for long.
                </li>
                <li>Discussions have been held between various bodies, including SEBI and the Reserve Bank of India
                    (RBI), on the possible ways in which this segment can be regulated.
                </li>
                <li>The central bank is of the view that these instruments are securities and so SEBI should be the
                    regulating body.

            <p><strong>About ICO:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>An ICO, like an equity initial public offer (IPO), is an issuance of digital tokens that can be
                    converted into crypto currencies and are mostly used to raise funds by start-up firms dealing in
                    blockchain technology and virtual currencies like bitcoins and ethereum.
                </li>
                <li>Unlike an IPO, which is governed by SEBI regulations, there is no regulatory body for ICOs in
                    India.

            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>According to data from UK-based CoinDesk, nearly $2.7 billion has been raised globally through ICOs

            <ul>
                <li>In the first six months of the current financial year, the country’s fiscal deficit touched 91.3
                    percent of the full-year budget estimate
                </li>

                    interest due to lenders to the Treasury – now exceeds trillion

            <ul>
                <li>This will be due to lower-than-budgeted revenues, which are because of</li>

            <p><strong>Basic Information:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>What is ‘Fiscal Deficit’?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A fiscal deficit occurs when a government’s total expenditures exceed the revenue that it generates,
                    excluding money from borrowings. Deficit differs from debt, which is an accumulation of yearly
                    deficits.
                </li>
                <li>A fiscal deficit is regarded by some as a positive economic event. For example, economist John
                    Maynard Keynes believed that deficits help countries climb out of economic recession. On the other
                    hand, fiscal conservatives feel that governments should avoid deficits in favor of a balanced budget
                    policy.

                <p><strong>Explanation</strong> </p>
                <p><strong>What is ‘Fiscal Deficit’?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A fiscal deficit occurs when a government’s total expenditures exceed the revenue that it
                        generates, excluding money from borrowings. Deficit differs from debt, which is an accumulation
                        of yearly deficits.
                    </li>
                    <li>A fiscal deficit is regarded by some as a positive economic event. For example, economist John
                        Maynard Keynes believed that deficits help countries climb out of economic recession. On the
                        other hand, fiscal conservatives feel that governments should avoid deficits in favor of a
                        balanced budget policy.

                    <li>An Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), like an equity initial public offer (IPO), is an issuance of

                        by start-up firms dealing in blockchain technology and virtual currencies like bitcoins and
                        ethereum.
                    </li>
                    <li>Unlike an IPO, which is governed by SEBI regulations, there is no regulatory body for ICOs in
                        India.

                <p>Nabakalebara festival is an ancient ritual that is observed in most of the Jaganath temples, Odisha.
                    In this festival, the idols of Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra and Sudarshan are replaced by
                    new idols. Nabakalebara is usually comes in every twelve to nineteen years based on the auspicious
                    two months of Ashadha as per the Hindu calendar.</p></div>

                <p><strong><br/> <em> (a)</em></strong></p>
                <p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>The Coriolis effect influences the paths of moving objects on Earth and is caused by Earth s
                    rotation. Because Earths surface rotates at different velocities at different latitudes, objects in
                    motion tend to veer to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern
                    Hemisphere. The Coriolis effect is nonexistent at the equator but increases with latitude, reaching
                    a maximum at the poles.</p></div>

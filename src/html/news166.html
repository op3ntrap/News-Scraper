                        the parameters.
                    </li>
                    <li>The government is proposing amendments to facilitate the establishment of commercial courts, at
                        the district level, in places where the High Courts have ordinary original civil jurisdiction.
                    </li>
                    <li>Legal remedy to commercial disputes and enforcement of business contracts are parameters of the

                    </li>
                    <li>In terms of ease of enforcing contracts, India jumped from 172 to 164.</li>
                    <li>The specified value of commercial disputes would be brought down so as to expand the scope of

                        draft protocol agreement on expanding bilateral ties being in place.

                        is not aimed at China and would “comply with the trend of times” which it identified as peace,
                        development, and cooperation.
                    </li>
                    <li>Washington was keen to have India, Japan, and Australia on board for a “productive” engagement,
                        while Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is likely to propose the same arrangement between the
                        four powers when President Donald Trump visits Tokyo on Monday.
                    </li>
                    <li>India has responded positively to the proposal, saying it has “an open mind to cooperate with
                        countries with convergence but obviously on an agenda which is relevant to us”.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Chinese Foreign Ministry said it has noted the development and hopes that such an
                        arrangement will promote mutual trust among countries in the region and not harm Beijing’s
                        interests.
                    </li>
                    <li>The US, India, Japan and Australia have growing concerns over China’s increasing assertiveness

                <p><strong>About GI:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A GI is primarily an agricultural, natural or a manufactured product (handicrafts and industrial
                        goods) originating from a definite geographical territory.
                    </li>
                    <li>Typically, such a name conveys an assurance of quality and distinctiveness, which is essentially
                        attributable to the place of its origin.
                    </li>
                    <li>Darjeeling tea, Tirupati laddu, Kangra paintings, Nagpur orange and Kashmir pashmina are among
                        the registered GIs in India.
                    </li>
                    <li>This tag gave protection to the producer of these genuine products, which commanded premium
                        pricing in the markets, both domestic and international.
                    </li>
                    <li>Once the GI protection is granted, no other producer can misuse the name to market similar
                        products. It also provides comfort to customers about the authenticity of that product

                    <li>The Navy is likely to go with an advanced <strong>catapult-based aircraft launch mechanism
                        (CATOBAR)</strong> from the U.S. for its second indigenous aircraft carrier (IAC-II), which is
                        on the drawing board.
                    </li>
                    <li>For some time, India has been exploring the possibility of installing the U.S. electromagnetic
                        aircraft launch system (EMALS).
                    </li>
                    <li>While the older generation of CATOBAR was powered by a steam catapult, EMALS uses an electric
                        motor-driven catapult instead, which allows the launch of much heavier aircraft and also reduces
                        the stress on the aircraft.
                    </li>
                    <li>EMALS will allow us to operate heavy surveillance aircraft in addition to heavy fighters.</li>
                    <li>The Navy envisages the IAC-II to be around 65,000 tonnes and capable of carrying over 50
                        aircraft.
                    </li>
                    <li>The two countries (India and the US) had set up a joint working group on Aircraft Carrier
                        Technology Cooperation (JWGACTC) under the <strong>Defence Technology and Trade
                            Initiative,</strong> which held several rounds of discussions.

                    <li>Using data from the NSSO, this report shows that labour force participation rate of women in
                        India has slipped dramatically in the last 20 years
                    </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The drop has been most dramatic among women in rural India</li>
                    <li>Research shows that while nearly half the rural women aged 15 years and above were “in the
                        labour force” in 1993-94, the number dropped to less than 36% in 2011-12.

                    <li>Labour force participation rate of urban women has also dropped in the same period.</li>

                        providing for death penalty or life imprisonment to those responsible for hooch deaths.

                    <li>The amendment will also make the offence non-bailable.</li>
                    <li>The new section seeks to provide that those convicted may be punished with life imprisonment, or
                        Rs 10 lakh penalty, or both, or death penalty, in case of death or permanent disability caused
                        to a person or persons due to consumption of illicit liquor.

                    <li>Every morning, the Bench, led by the Chief Justice of India, gives leeway to lawyers who appear
                        in cases that require an urgent hearing.
                    </li>
                    <li>Lawyers must convince the top judge, very briefly, that without an urgent hearing, the rights,
                        even the fundamental rights, of their clients may suffer a grievous harm.
                    </li>

                    <li>Chief Justice Misra, declared in a crowded courtroom that only advocates-on-record would
                        henceforth make urgent mentions. This was aimed at providing a level playing field, and assuring
                        the legal community that the case in question, and not the advocate, would guide the court’s
                        discretion to grant an early hearing.

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Key Fact:</strong> It is the <strong>first initiative</strong> under a <strong>Indo-Russia</strong>
                        deal to undertake atomic energy projects in third countries.
                    </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Indian nuclear establishment for years has not been able to grow, internationally, due to
                        sanctions imposed on New Delhi post the <strong>1974</strong> <strong>Pokhran tests. </strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>The Roppur project, which is being built by the Russians near Dhaka, will be Bangladesh’s first
                        atomic energy project.
                    </li>
                    <li>After commissioning of two units, each with a capacity of 1200 MWs, Bangladesh will be the third
                        South Asian country after India and Pakistan to harness energy from atomic fission.
                    </li>
                    <li>India signed a civil nuclear cooperation deal with Bangladesh under which the two sides can
                        supply and manufacture equipment, material for the atomic power plant.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Concerns</strong>: It is not clear what kind of “collaboration” India was doing since it

                            <li>As per the new notification issued by Government of India, all peer-to-peer lending
                                (P2P) platforms will be regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
                            </li>
                            <li>All the P2P loan platforms will be treated as non-banking financial companies (NBFCs)
                                and will be brought under the ambit of the banking regulator.
                            </li>

                            <li>Although nascent in India and not significant in value yet, the potential benefits that
                                P2P lending promises to various stakeholders (borrowers, lenders, agencies etc.) and its
                                associated risks to the financial system are too important to be ignored.
                            </li>
                            <li>P2P lending promotes alternative forms of finance, where formal finance is unable to
                                reach and also has the potential to soften the lending rates as a result of lower
                                operational costs and enhanced competition with the traditional lending channels. If
                                properly regulated, P2P lending platforms can do this more effectively
                            </li>
                            <li>According to RBI, P2P lending is a form of crowd funding used to raise loans which are
                                paid back with interest.It can be defined as the use of an online platform that matches
                                lenders with borrowers in order to provide unsecured loans.

                        <ul>
                            <li>The Department of Science and Technology (DST) is planning to fund a project to develop
                                quantum computers.

                        <p><strong>What is a quantum computer: </strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A quantum computer, still largely a <strong>theoretical entity</strong>, employs the
                                principles of quantum mechanics to store information in ‘<strong>qubits</strong>’
                                instead of the typical ‘bits’ of 1 and 0.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Advantages</strong>: Qubits work faster because of the way such circuits are
                                designed, and their promise is that they can do intensive number-crunching tasks much
                                more efficiently than the fastest comparable computers.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>For Example: </strong>to sort a billion numbers, a quantum computer would
                                require <strong>5 million</strong> fewer steps than a traditional machine, and would
                                find the solution in only <strong>31,623 steps.</strong></li>

                            <li>Internationally, Canada’s D-Wave Systems, is a pioneer in developing quantum computers

                            <li>Going by recent reports, it appears that the Union government is contemplating
                                withdrawing all kind of incentives that are being provided to renewable-based
                                electricity by 2022.
                            </li>
                            <li>It is said that there will not be any targeting of renewable energy after 2020
                                (presumably no renewable purchase obligations, or RPOs, after 2022).
                            </li>
                            <li>Moreover, the draft National Energy Policy 2017 proposes gradual withdrawal of the
                                provision of “must run” status and other support such as non-levy of interstate

                            <li>The sharp reduction in bids for solar and wind power forms the basis of the argument
                                that now these technologies are ready to face markets.

                            <li>While the record low prices of solar power in the recent past have been on account of
                                very low global prices of solar photovoltaic modules and accessories.

                                renewable electricity prices.
                            </li>
                            <li>The Solar Energy Corp. of India wind power auction contained three very crucial
                                elements-
                            </li>

                            <li>So, doing away with such provisions appears to be totally counter-productive to India’s
                                ambitions in this field.

                            <li>The recent outcomes of the solar and wind auctions may have made officials to take for
                                granted that the things will continue to move in a certain way but at the same time
                                ignoring the key parameters that helped chart out that direction in the first place.

                            <li>Undoubtedly, a good policy framework has to have sunset clauses for incentives but
                                withdrawals must also be nuanced and gradual, arrived at after taking into account their
                                long-term implications on the sector.

                                coal-based power generation.
                            </li>

                                includes “the opportunity cost of stranded conventional power assets” as one of the
                                components of the social cost.
                            </li>

                                plants becomes the most significant contributor to renewable energy’s social cost,
                                making it three time more expensive than conventional power.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>According to Central Electricity Authority, the share of renewable electricity in
                                India’s total electricity generation was around 7.6% between April 2016 and March 2017.
                                So how can this be the reason for below-par plant load factors of coal power plants?

                                would ever be possible because during the transition stage, the older assets are bound
                                to be underutilized or in a sense, financially stranded. Examples- UJALA, or Unnat Jyoti
                                by Affordable Lighting for All, scheme that aims to promote efficient use of energy.
                                This whole UJALA campaign must also be rendering manufacturers of incandescent lamps in
                                a state of financial stress, so is that being factored in while estimating the social
                                cost of LED lamps? The same also goes for electrical vehicles that surely would result
                                in the supply chain of conventional automobile components becoming stranded assets?
                            </li>
                            <li>And how transparently does this “social cost” dispensation take into account the cost of
                                longer term impacts of different alternatives?
                            </li>
                            <li>How accurate are the cost-components and how close are the assumptions to Indian
                                realities?
                            </li>
                            <li>Public health in any case is always heavily discounted in all such calculations.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>A good policy regime tries to balance these seemingly divergent viewpoints and provides
                                direction for long-term and sustainable solutions for larger public good. This is
                                particularly critical when the decisions made today could have far-reaching implications
                                for generations to come.
                            </li>
                            <li>Besides, basing such decisions on anecdotal premise rather than on sound analytical
                                evidence could very well jeopardize the momentum that renewable energy sector in the
                                country has gained.
                            </li>
                            <li>It appears as if there is a lack of cohesion within different arms of the government,
                                leading to conflicting signals.
                            </li>
                            <li>This, however, needs to be managed quickly to avoid the serious implications such mixed
                                signals could have on our commitment to achieve about 40% of installed power capacity
                                from non-fossil fuels by 2030.

                                    <li>Flammable ice (also known as methane hydrate or methane clathrates)consists of
                                        methane trapped within water crystals. It is the world’s largest natural gas
                                        resource trapped beneath permafrost and ocean sediment where low temperature and
                                        moderate pressure combine to trap methane in this specific way.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Permafrost appears on top of it. Permafrost is frozen chunks of ice that often
                                        contain carbon and volatile gases.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>China has successfully produced natural gas from methane hydrate, also known
                                        as“flammable ice”, in an experimental project in the South China Sea (SCS).Most
                                        of its reserves are located deep in ocean floors, especially continental
                                        shelves.

                                    <li>The methane hydrate is highly flammable and energy-intensive fuel as one cubic
                                        metre of the compound can releases about 160 cubic metres of gas.

                                    <li>It can break down into water and methane after temperature is raised or pressure
                                        is lowered.

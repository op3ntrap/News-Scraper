                <li>The Kerala government has raised the legal drinking age from 21 to 23 years</li>
                <li>The State Cabinet has decided to amend the Abkari Act for the purpose.</li>
                <li>The previous UDF government had adopted a pro-prohibitionist policy by shutting down bars and
                    closing state-run liquor vending outlets to reduce the availability of legal liquor.
                </li>
                <li>But in September this year, the LDF government eased the norms for four star and above bars by
                    reducing the mandatory offset from places of worship and educational institutions from 200 metres to
                    50 metres, touching off a State-wide scramble to upgrade bars and hotels.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Key Fact:</strong> Maharashtra and New Delhi had raised the age to 25 but found it had
                    little impact on the ground.

                        <li>From 2013 to 2016, the tourism sector in North East grew by 5.2 per cent. During this
                            period, 77 lakh domestic and 1.6 lakh foreign tourists visited the region.

            <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>On August 22, the Supreme Court struck down triple talaq, calling the practice unconstitutional and
                    in violation of <strong>Article 14</strong> of the Constitution.

                <li>Uttar Pradesh has become the first State to endorse the Central government’s draft bill that makes
                    instant <strong>triple talaq</strong> a <strong>cognisable</strong> and <strong>non-bailable
                        offence</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>The draft law, provides for three-year imprisonment and a fine to a man trying to divorce his wife
                    by uttering “talaq” three times.

            <ul>
                <li>The draft <strong>‘Muslim Women Protection of Rights on Marriage Bill’</strong> was sent by the
                    Centre to the States as the practice continued despite the Supreme Court striking it down.
                </li>
                <li>The draft was prepared by an inter-ministerial group headed by Home Minister Rajnath Singh.</li>
                <li>The proposed law would only be applicable on instant triple talaq or ‘talaq-e-biddat’ and it would
                    give power to the victim to approach a magistrate seeking “subsistence allowance” for herself and
                    minor children.
                </li>
                <li>The woman can also seek the custody of her minor children from the magistrate who will take a final
                    call on the issue.
                </li>
                <li>Under the draft law, triple talaq in any form — spoken, in writing or by electronic means such as
                    email, SMS and WhatsApp — would be bad or illegal and void.
                </li>
                <li>The provision of subsistence allowance and custody has been made to ensure that in case the husband
                    asks the wife to leave the house she should have legal protection.

                <li>Government in 2015 even attempted to make the offence compoundable.This would have allowed
                    complainants to enter into a compromise with the accused and agree to have the charges dropped
                </li>
                <li>Making the dowry law compoundable was also among the recommendations made by the <strong>Law

                <li>Various courts, including the Supreme Court, have over the years called Section 498A as being prone

                <li>In 2014, the SC said that it had a “dubious place of pride amongst the provisions that are used as

                            regime (MECR) with 41 participating states.
                        </li>
                        <li>The Wassenaar Arrangement was established to contribute to regional and international
                            security and stability by promoting transparency and greater responsibility in transfers of
                            conventional arms and dual-use goods and technologies, thus preventing destabilizing
                            accumulations.
                        </li>
                        <li>Participating states seek, through their national policies, to ensure that transfers of
                            these items do not contribute to the development or enhancement of military capabilities
                            which undermine these goals, and are not diverted to support such capabilities.
                        </li>
                        <li>Every six months member countries exchange information on deliveries of conventional arms to
                            non-Wassenaar members that fall under eight broad weapons categories: battle tanks, armoured
                            fighting vehicles (AFVs), large-caliber artillery, military aircraft, military helicopters,
                            warships, missiles or missile systems, and small arms and light weapons.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Admission requires states to: </strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Be a producer or exporter of arms or sensitive industrial equipment</li>
                        <li>Maintain non-proliferation policies and appropriate national policies, including adherence

                        </li>
                        <li>Maintain fully effective export controls</li>
                        <li>The People’s Republic of China and Israel are not members, but they have aligned their
                            export controls with Wassenaar lists, and are significant arms exporters. The Arrangement is
                            open on a global and non-discriminatory basis to prospective adherents that comply with the
                            agreed criteria

                    <p><strong>Monetary Policy Tools: </strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)</strong> is a specified minimum fraction of the total deposits
                        of customers, which commercial banks have to hold as reserves either in cash or as deposits with
                        the central bank.</p>
                    <p><strong> Statutory liquidity ratio (SLR)</strong> is the Indian government term for reserve
                        requirement that the commercial banks in India require to maintain in the form of gold,
                        government approved securities before providing credit to the customers.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Statutory Liquidity Ratio is determined by Reserve Bank of India maintained by banks in
                            order to control the expansion of bank credit.
                        </li>
                        <li>The SLR is determined by a percentage of total demand and time liabilities. Time Liabilities
                            refer to the liabilities which the commercial banks are liable to pay to the customers after
                            a certain period mutually agreed upon, and demand liabilities are such deposits of the
                            customers which are payable on demand. An example of time liability is a six month fixed
                            deposit which is not payable on demand but only after six months. An example of demand
                            liability is a deposit maintained in saving account or current account that is payable on
                            demand through a withdrawal form such as a cheque.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Repo rate</strong> is the rate at which the central bank of a country (Reserve Bank of
                        India in case of India) lends money to commercial banks in the event of any shortfall of funds.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In the event of inflation, central banks increase repo rate as this acts as a disincentive
                            for banks to borrow from the central bank. This ultimately reduces the money supply in the
                            economy and thus helps in arresting inflation.
                        </li>
                        <li>The central bank takes the contrary position in the event of a fall in inflationary
                            pressures.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Reverse repo rate</strong> is the rate at which the central bank of a country (Reserve
                        Bank of India in case of India) borrows money from commercial banks within the country.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is a monetary policy instrument which can be used to control the money supply in the
                            country.
                        </li>
                        <li>Repo and reverse repo rates form a part of the liquidity adjustment facility.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Marginal standing facility (MSF)</strong> is a window for banks to borrow from the
                        Reserve Bank of India in an emergency situation when inter-bank liquidity dries up completely.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Banks borrow from the central bank by pledging government securities at a rate higher than
                            the repo rate under liquidity adjustment facility or LAF in short. The MSF rate is pegged
                            100 basis points or a percentage point above the repo rate. Under MSF, banks can borrow
                            funds up to one percentage of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL).
                        </li>
                        <li>Bank rate is the rate charged by the central bank for lending funds to commercial banks.
                        </li>
                        <li>Bank rates influence lending rates of commercial banks. Higher bank rate will translate to
                            higher lending rates by the banks. In order to curb liquidity, the central bank can resort
                            to raising the bank rate and vice versa.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Market Stabilization scheme (MSS)</strong> is a monetary policy intervention by the RBI
                        to withdraw excess liquidity (or money supply) by selling government securities in the economy.
                        The MSS was introduced in April 2004. Main thing about MSS is that it is used to withdraw excess
                        liquidity or money from the system by selling government bonds.</p>
                    <p><strong>Open market operations (OMO)</strong> refers to the buying and selling of government
                        securities in the open market in order to expand or contract the amount of money in the banking
                        system, facilitated by the RBI.</p></div>

                <li>The proposed <strong>recapitalisation </strong>of public sector banks will include a package of
                    reforms.
                </li>
                <li>The Centre had announced a Rs.11 lakh crore recapitalisation plan for PSU banks, of which Rs.1.35
                    lakh crore would be raised <strong>through recapitalisation bonds</strong>.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why recapitalization?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reeling under the pressure of poor asset quality over the last three years, PSU banks have seen
                    their capital erode.
                </li>
                <li>Apart from making provisions for bad loans, the lenders would need capital to meet the <strong>Basel-III
                    norms</strong> and to support their business growth.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Priority for infusion</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The banks that had managed their balance sheets ‘well’ would be given priority for capital infusion
                    while others would have to show the resolve to reform.
                </li>
                <li>Recap bonds will be front loaded for banks that have managed their balance sheet strengths more
                    prudently and can use injected capital to lend besides providing for legacy asset losses.

            <p><strong>Anti-profiteering methodology</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>India may adopt a product-specific approach similar to that of Australia to ensure that the full
                    benefit of price reductions due to the goods and services tax (GST) is passed on to consumers
                </li>
                <li>This means that when the authority gets any complaint, it will examine the input tax credit flowing
                    into a product and the resultant reduction in total tax
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Success rate of Anti-profiteering :</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enforcing this will be a tall order especially because anti-profiteering has not been a success in
                    most countries where implemented.Australia, Malaysia, Canada and New Zealand are some countries
                    where anti-profiteering or similar provisions have been put in place
                </li>
                <li>It crimped corporate profitability and it could also result in <strong>tax terrorism.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Reasons:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Such provision can work only when things like raw material costs do not swing sharply</li>
                <li>There are many such variables and they would differ from one company to another, adding to the
                    implementation challenge
                </li>
                <li>The movement in prices is also a function of the demand-supply scenario.</li>

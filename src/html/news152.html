            </ul>
            <p><strong>Deadline extended:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The deadline for mandatory linking of Aadhaar to avail benefits of government schemes has been
                    postponed to March 31, 2018, the Centre informed the Supreme Court.
                </li>
                <li>Union government will take no coercive action against those who do not have Aadhaar and they will
                    not be denied social welfare scheme benefits till March 31.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key Fact:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Aadhaar is a 12-digit biometric identity.</li>
                <li><strong>Coverage:</strong> As many as 135 schemes (of 35 ministries) including the free cooking gas
                    (LPG) to poor women, kerosene and fertilizer subsidy, targeted public distribution system (PDS) and
                    MGNREGA will be covered by the extension.

            <ul>
                <li>Challenges the constitutional validity of the decision to make linking of mobile numbers and bank
                    accounts with Aadhaar a must.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Contention raised:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The issue of mandatory linking of Aadhaar with bank accounts and mobile number is illegal.</li>
                <li>Non-linking of Aadhaar with bank account would make citizens liable for prosecution under the
                    Prevention of Money Laundering Act.
                </li>
                <li>Supreme Court is still hearing a petition to make the unique ID mandatory for availing of government
                    benefits.

        <div id="Going back to the basics">
            <p><strong>Highlights of a report by The World Bank:</strong> <strong>“Learning to Realize Education’s
                Promise”</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Main theme:</strong> focus on education</li>
                <li><strong>Important highlights:</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>First: The report makes a moral case for education</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It does it with a rights-based approach</li>
                <li>And sub-sections titled ‘Education as freedom’; ‘Education improves individual freedoms’; ‘Education
                    benefits all of society’
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Second: Early childhood development</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>One of the most important sections is not about education but about early childhood development</li>
                <li>The report discusses the far-reaching impact of poverty and chronic malnutrition on the physical and
                    mental development of children
                </li>
                <li>The effects of stunting in the early years on physical, cognitive and socio-emotional development
                    prevent children from learning well in later years
                </li>
                <li>The report points out that in low-income countries, stunting rates among children under-five are
                    almost three times higher than in the richest
                </li>
                <li>Reduction of child stunting should be one of the major moral imperatives before nations today</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Third: Role of technology</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is good to see that technology is not regarded as a panacea in itself</li>
                <li>But as something that has the potential to enhance learning and that the teacher-learner
                    relationship is at the centre of learning
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Fourth: issue of public vs private schools</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The report acknowledges firmly that on the issue of public vs private schools, the results are still
                    mixed
                </li>
                <li>There is no consistent evidence that private schools deliver better learning outcomes than public
                    schools, or the opposite
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Fifth: Shortage of teachers</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>While school enrolments have increased significantly, massive teacher shortages persist</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Sixth: Other related issues behind learning crisis</strong></p>
            <p>Beyond reading and arithmetic, any meaningful assessment of learning should also consider aspects such as
                comprehension, problem solving, critical thinking, and innovation</p>
            <p>Beyond merely increasing assessment it is equally important to fund</p>
            <p>(1) The sector better;</p>
            <p>(2) improve teacher training;</p>
            <p>(3) support the continuing professional development of teachers;</p>
            <p>(4) And help teachers to help the poorest children to learn</p>
            <p><strong>The way forward</strong></p>
            <p>One would have liked to see greater focus on the continuing problems of access and equity, which are
                still the biggest problems in education.If there is one aspect of education which needs to be quantified
                and measured in order to make our education systems function better for all children, it is equity</p>

        <div id="U.S. makes H-1B visa renewals tougher">
            <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fresh changes in rules notified by the <strong>S. Citizenship and Immigration Services
                    (USCIS) </strong>for <strong>renewal of non-immigrant visas</strong> will severely impact <strong>H-1B
                    visa holders.</strong></li>
                <li>Increasing restrictions on H-1B visa programme remains a point of concern in the India-US relations,
                    as a majority of these guest workers are Indians.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>New rules notified:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>“The updated guidance instructs officers to apply the same level of scrutiny when reviewing
                    nonimmigrant visa extension requests even where the petitioner, beneficiary and underlying facts are
                    unchanged from a previously approved petition. While adjudicators may ultimately reach the same
                    conclusion as in a prior decision, they are not compelled to do so as a default starting point as
                    the burden of proof to establish eligibility for an immigration benefit always lies with the
                    petitioner,”.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Updated guidance provides clear direction to help advance policies that protect the interests of
                    U.S. workers.
                </li>
                <li>The new rules are in line with the Donald Trump administration’s <strong>Buy American, Hire American
                    policy</strong>.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Three types of status updates issued by USCIS:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>An H-1B worker goes to the USCIS for three types of changes to his status – amendment, transfer and
                    renewal.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Amendments are sought when an H-1B employee changes the location within the same company;
                        </li>
                        <li>transfer is sought when he moves from one company to another, and</li>
                        <li>A renewal is sought at the expiry of the visa, which is usually issued for three years at
                            the beginning.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Adjudicators must thoroughly review the petition and supporting evidence to determine eligibility
                    for the benefit sought
                </li>
                <li>The previous policy — which has been in force for 13 years — instructed officers to give deference
                    to the findings of a previously approved petition, as long as the key elements were unchanged and
                    there was no evidence of a material error or fraud related to the prior determination.

            <ul>
                <li>The Centre’s decision to infuse ₹11 lakh crore into public sector banks will be credit positive and
                    the amount is large enough to comprehensively address their weak capital profile.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Key Fact:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>For the 11 rated public sector banks by Moody’s, the rating agency estimates that their external
                    capital requirements over the next two years would be about ₹70,000 crore to ₹95,000 crore.
                </li>
                <li>This estimate factors in the capital requirements for compliance with Basel-III norms and for
                    conservative recognition and provisioning of their asset quality problems.

            <p><strong>Indian e-commerce sector expansion:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Union government is working on a new policy to expand the footprint of the Indian e-commerce

                </li>
                <li>Currently, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology is looking at tapping markets such

            <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reference used at present: </strong>For 125 years, a salt-shaker-sized cylinder housed at
                    the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), Paris and weighing exactly a kilogram served
                    as the definition of the measure. The cylinder is made of 90% platinum and 10% iridium
                </li>
                <li>However, an international conference of heads of metrology institutes decided, on October 19 in
                    Sevres, France, that the kilogram will no longer be pegged to this cylinder.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>No more artefacts</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>In essence, the units were freed from being defined on the basis of artefacts, as these being
                    objects, were subject to wear and tear and sources of eventual error.
                </li>
                <li>The new artefacts, according to the International Committee for Weights and Measures, ought to
                    derive from the constants of nature that are all interdependent.
                </li>
                <li>These include constants such as the Planck constant — the ratio of the electromagnetic radiation
                    from a photon to its frequency — and the charge of an electron.
                </li>
                <li>Until this month, the kilogram was the only one among the units still pegged to a real object and
                    now — after a formal vote in 2018 — the world is set to redefine the kilogram in terms of the Planck
                    constant, the second and the metre.

            <ul>
                <li>A near-complete Jurassic-era fossil of an intriguing animal that looks like a mashup of a dolphin
                    and lizard, and lived during the twilight of the dinosaurs, has been unearthed in <strong>Kutch,
                        Gujarat</strong>.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Ichthyosaurs, or ‘fish- lizards’</strong> in Greek, were large reptiles that lived at the
                    same time as dinosaurs.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Key Fact: </strong></li>
                <li>While many ichthyosaur fossils have been found in <strong>North America and Europe</strong>, the
                    fossil record in the Southern Hemisphere has mostly been limited to <strong>South America and
                        Australia</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>It is the first Jurassic ichthyosaur found in India.</li>
                <li>Discovery throws light on the evolution and diversity of ichthyosaurs in the <strong>Indo-Madagascan
                    region</strong> of the former Gondwanaland and India’s biological connectivity with other continents
                    in the Jurassic.

                    <li>Originally headed by the Viceroy of India, it was transformed into a council of ministers, with
                        the powers of a prime minister bestowed on the vice-president of the Council, a position held by
                        the Congress leader Jawaharlal Nehru.

                    <li>After independence all members would be Indians, apart from the Viceroy, in August to become the

                        One species can be found in Africa. They can be found at altitudes from sea level to 4200
                        meters, from rainforests to deserts. 1814 species are epiphytes, some are lithophytes, and some
                        are terrestrial. Accordingly, these plants can be found in the Andean highlands, from northern
                        Chile to Colombia, in the Sechura Desert of coastal Peru, in the cloud forests of Central and
                        South America, in southern United States from southern Virginia to Florida to Texas, and in far

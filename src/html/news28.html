                                <li>A shell company is described as a non-trading organization that does not engage in

                                <li>Shell companies are usually listed on the stock exchange and are not illegal

                                        <p>Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, previously DEXA) is a means of
                                            measuring bone mineral density (BMD). Two X-ray beams, with different energy
                                            levels, are aimed at the patient’s bones. When soft tissue absorption is
                                            subtracted out, the BMD can be determined from the absorption of each beam
                                            by bone. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry is the most widely used and most
                                            thoroughly studied bone density measurement technology.</p></div>

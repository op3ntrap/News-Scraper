            <p><strong>Supreme Court advice to Centre:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Election Commissioners should be selected through the “most transparent and just process” formalised
                    in a law enacted by Parliament.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Supreme Court observation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>There is a “gap” caused by the <strong>lack of a parliamentary law</strong> which transparently
                    spells out the process of appointment of an election commissioner: “Who should be shortlisted? Who
                    shortlists these names? What is the eligibility?
                </li>
                <li><strong>Key Fact:</strong> selection procedure of the CBI Director is formalised by a written law,
                    but not that of Election Commissioners.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Practice at present:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The filtering of names of suitable persons for appointment as Election Commissioners is done under
                    the aegis of the Prime Minister and his Cabinet, who in turn advise the President.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Constitutional obligation:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Article 324. Superintendence, direction and control of elections to be vested in an Election
                Commission</strong></p>

                such number of other Election Commissioners, if any, as the President may from time to time fix and the
                appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners shall, <strong>subject

            <ul>
                <li>Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s provocation on Kashmir by equating the Kashmir
                    conflict with those in Yemen and Bahrain
                </li>
                <li>India has always been worried of Iran’s support for Pakistan in the Organisation of Islamic
                    Cooperation (OIC) regarding Kashmir.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Reason for Iran’s interference in Kashmir issue</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>India’s growing closeness to Saudi Arabia and the UAE</li>
                <li>Reminder to India that Iran too has a role in the Islamic world which can’t be ignored.</li>
                <li>Iran getting regionally isolated in the backdrop of Donald Trump administration’s hard line against
                    Tehran

            </ul>
            <p><strong>What is happening in Arab world?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Blockade of Qatar by Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and UAE after cutting off their diplomatic ties
                </li>
                <li>Arab states issued a 13-point demands to Qatar to curb diplomatic ties with Iran, severing ties with
                    the Muslim Brotherhood and shuttering the Al-Jazeera news network
                </li>
                <li>Saudi Arabia and Iran’s proxy wars across the region — in Bahrain, Syria, Yemen, apart from their
                    growing hostility in Iraq.
                </li>
                <li>Attack on Iran’s Parliament , for which it blames Saudi Arabia, has further heightened the
                    tensions.

            </ul>
            <p><strong>India’s irking economic ties with Iran</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Iran hasn’t taken a decision on contract for gas exploration in its Farzad B offshore field.</li>
                <li>So India has decided to decrease the volume of Iranian crude oil it will be buying this year.</li>
                <li>There are reports that Tehran has signed an agreement for the gas field with Russian giant
                    Gazprom.

            </ul>
            <p><strong>How it affects India?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>For India, this undercuts the very strategic utility of the port</li>
                <li>Chabahar port is viewed as India’s answer to the Gwadar port and to circumvent Pakistan and open up

                        and trees in the Western Ghats, some of which have not been assessed by international
                        conservation bodies for nearly two decades.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Botanical Survey of India (BSI) project on endemic tree resources in the southern Western
                        Ghats, including Kerala and Tamil Nadu, has now documented about 250 ‘RET’ species.

                        for the IUCN Red List puts them under vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered categories

                                and Hopea parviflora now have better records.

                            nurture innovative start-ups. The purpose of the scheme is to identify 100 most innovative
                            start-ups in the state to elevate them to the next level of success. The Elevate scheme is
                            the brainchild of the start-up cell, Karnataka Biotechnology and Information Technology
                            Services (KBITS), to help start-ups across the state succeed by providing them with access
                            to mentors, networking opportunities, and in-depth sessions for start-ups on accounting, and
                            emerging technologies.</p></div>

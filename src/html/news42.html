                <li>Falun Gong, the ancient Chinese holistic system that is banned in China, will be celebrated in India
                    on July 15 with a parade and Human Word Formation in New Delhi
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Basic Information:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Falun Gong:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Falun Gong (literally, “Dharma Wheel Practice” or “Law Wheel Practice”) is a Chinese spiritual
                    practice that combines meditation and <strong>qigong exercises</strong> with a moral philosophy
                    centered on the tenets of truthfulness, compassion, and forbearance
                </li>
                <li>The practice emphasizes morality and the cultivation of virtue, and identifies as a qigong practice
                    of the Buddhist school, though its teachings also incorporate elements drawn from Taoist traditions.
                    Through moral rectitude and the practice of meditation, practitioners of Falun Gong aspire to
                    eliminate attachments, and ultimately to achieve spiritual enlightenment.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Qigong</strong> is a holistic system of coordinated body posture and movement, breathing,
                    and meditation used for health, spirituality, and martial arts training
                </li>

            <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Union Government’s May 26 notification:</strong> banned cattle sale in livestock markets for
                    slaughter and religious sacrifices.
                </li>
                <li>The rules banned trading in cattle for slaughter at animal markets. The rules included buffaloes in
                    their definition of cattle, raising concerns that they would jeopardize the buffalo meat export
                    business as the supply chain of spent buffaloes will be disrupted.
                </li>
                <li>The Central rules drew criticism from various quarters, including opposition parties, who argued
                    that they virtually ban the sale of cattle in the country.<strong> </strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>In news:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Supreme Court stayed the Centre’s May 26 notification.</li>
                <li><strong>Government’s stance: </strong>the government acquiesced that public outcry and objections
                    from the States about the law’s impact on livelihoods made it realise that the rules need
                    “tweaking”.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Additional Solicitor- General P. Narasimha response:</strong> the government had received a
                    “large number of representations” that “certain aspects” of the <strong>Prevention of Cruelty to
                        Animals (Regulation of Livestock Markets) Rules, 2017 and the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
                        (Maintenance of Case Property Animals) Act, 2017</strong> were “troubling” and threw up some
                    “sensitive” questions about the Central rules.

            <ul>
                <li>International students can stay in the U.S. as long as they are enrolled for a programme.</li>
                <li>Students who enter the U.S on <strong>F-1 visas</strong> are issued an entry document with an end
                    date that states “duration of stay”, which is theoretically open-ended. They can stay as long as
                    they have a valid I-20 document, which is issued by the university, with all details regarding the
                    student’s programme of study, financing, etc. They can also move from one programme to another and
                    from one institution to another, by a notification, based on a new I-20 document that the
                    institution issues.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key fact:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Indians are the fastest growing group among the international student population in the U.S.</li>
                <li>There are 1,66,000 students from India pursuing higher education in the U.S. now, up from about
                    1,00,000 two years earlier. A large majority of them pursue science, technology, engineering and
                    math courses.
                </li>
                <li>Around 1.4 million international students are currently present in the U.S.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>New proposed Changes: </strong>Foreign students in the United States may be required to reapply
                every year for permission to stay in the country.</p>
            <p><strong>Impacts:</strong> The proposed measures could increase costs and paper work for students and
                universities.</p>
            <p><strong>Why such a move?</strong></p>
            <p><span>The proposal is part of an ongoing review of the immigration policy to ensure that it “promotes the national interest, enhances national security and public safety and ensures the integrity of our immigration system.”</span>

            <ul>
                <li>The government on Monday raised the import duty on sugar to 50 per cent from 40 per cent to
                    discourage dumping of cheaper supplies from abroad and as local prices stabilise after a spike
                    earlier this marketing year

                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Relief for producers:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The hike in the duty comes as a relief for mills amid slowing domestic demand, especially after
                    demonetisation
                </li>
                <li>Cost of production is also increased due to high cane prices</li>
                <li>This will help the sugar industry pay the cane price (fair and remunerative price), which has been
                    raised by 11 per cent for the marketing year starting October 2017
                </li>

            <p><strong>Sugar import:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>In April this year, the government had allowed duty-free imports of raw sugar up to five lakh tonnes
                    to improve domestic availability
                </li>
                <li>It was due to fear that a drop in domestic output in 2016-17 could trigger a spiral in prices to
                    irrational levels
                </li>

            <ul>
                <li>Indian Railways has taken a big step in a plan to promote micro and small enterprises</li>
                <li>It has reserved 358 items including cleaning apparatus, stationery and leather items exclusively for
                    procurement from the MSE sector
                </li>
                <li>Besides, the sector has been exempted from paying tender cost and earnest money deposit for
                    participating in the railway tender
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Other changes:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>MSEs will be now encouraged to participate in the business of maintenance and operation of rolling
                    stock and also in procurement of cables, linen, paints, coupler body, wall panelling, cutting and
                    drilling machines

                <li>A group of U.S. researchers is working on a system to map undulating pollution trends in the
                    Godavari.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>New approach:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using a mix of methods, including satellite-monitoring, traversing stretches of the river to collect
                    water samples and using special sensors to measure bacterial and chemical pollution, the researchers
                    are trying to develop a cost-effective forecast system.
                </li>
                <li>The team’s long-term objective is to be able to inform State officials and citizens of a probable
                    spike in, say, levels of dangerous microbes or effluents, similar to weather and air pollution
                    forecasts
                </li>
                <li>It is to be able to access “raw data” that could be used to inform the efficacy of a proposed faecal
                    sludge treatment plant and whether behavioural interventions — including incentives or punishments —
                    to restrict activities that pollute the river could actually work.
                </li>
                <li>The project measures parameters such as total dissolved salts, nitrate, pH, temperature, turbidity
                    and electrical conductivity. These are relayed to a website called Thoreau, a wireless sensing
                    network maintained at the University of Chicago to map environmental parameters, for analysis. Some
                    river attributes such as microbial levels require to be measured in laboratories, though the team
                    hopes eventually to be able to use low-cost sensors that measure them, too, in real time.

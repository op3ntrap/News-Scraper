            <ul>
                <li>The Supreme Court directed that no arrest or coercive action should be taken on such complaints
                    without ascertaining the veracity of allegations.
                </li>
                <li>Supreme Court acknowledged a growing trend among women involved in marital discord to abuse <strong>Section
                    498A of IPC</strong> to rope in their husbands’ relatives — including parents, minor children,
                    siblings and grandparents — in criminal cases and said it was high time such frivolous cases which
                    violated the human rights of innocent was checked.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Paradigm shift</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The above observation is a shift from the dominant judicial conception of women as victims who would
                    silently suffer injustice rather than bring disrepute to their family by taking domestic conflict
                    outside the four walls of the home.

            </ul>
            <p><strong>Family welfare committee (FWC) and other mechanism recommended</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Supreme Court directed all states to set up <strong>family welfare committee (FWC)</strong> in
                    each district and tasked them with testing the veracity of every complaint.
                </li>
                <li>The bench ruled that all such complaints received by the police or the magistrate must be referred
                    to the family welfare committee and no action should be taken against the husband and the in-laws
                    till the committee gave its report after interacting with the parties.
                </li>
                <li>Report of such committee be given to the authority by whom the complaint is referred to, latest
                    within one month from the date of receipt of complaint
                </li>
                <li>The court also said bail applications of husband and in-laws should be decided expeditiously by
                    trial courts, preferably the same day it is filed.
                </li>
                <li>The court further said impounding of passports or issuance of Red Corner Notice against person
                    living abroad should be avoided and personal appearance of husband’s family members should not be
                    insisted upon by trial courts in dowry harassment cases.
                </li>
                <li>It also directed that a designated police officer should be appointed to deal with complaints under

            <li>This is contrary to the government’s earlier stand that citizens cannot invoke privacy as a fundamental

        <p><strong>In news:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Madras high court has advised family courts not to treat husbands like <strong>“armless
                soldiers”</strong> and not to order them to pay maintenance to wives in a <strong>“mechanical
                manner.”</strong></li>
            <li>A man is a son to his parents and is liable to maintain his aged parents as well, the high court said,
                adding that family courts should not brush this aspect aside lightly and go to the extent of paying even
                two-thirds of his income to his estranged wife.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Section 125 in The Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973</strong></p>
        <p><strong>125. Order for maintenance of wives, children and parents.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>(1)</strong> If any person having sufficient means neglects or refuses to maintain-</p>
        <p>(a) his wife, unable to maintain herself, or</p>
        <p>(b) his legitimate or illegitimate minor child, whether married or not, unable to maintain itself, or</p>
        <p>1. Subs. by Act 45 of 1978, s. 12, for” Chief Judicial Magistrate” (w. e. f, 18- 12- 1978 ).</p>
        <p>(c) his legitimate or illegitimate child (not being a married daughter) who has attained majority, where such
            child is, by reason of any physical or mental abnormality or injury unable to maintain itself, or</p>
        <p>(d) his father or mother, unable to maintain himself or herself, a Magistrate of the first class may, upon
            proof of such neglect or refusal, order such person to make a monthly allowance for the maintenance of his
            wife or such child, father or mother, at such monthly rate not exceeding five hundred rupees in the whole,
            as such Magistrate thinks fit, and to pay the same to such person as the Magistrate may from time to time
            direct: Provided that the Magistrate may order the father of a minor female child referred to in clause (b)
            to make such allowance, until she attains her majority, if the Magistrate is satisfied that the husband of
            such minor female child, if married, is not possessed of sufficient means. Explanation.- For the purposes of
            this Chapter,-</p>
        <p>(a) ” minor” means a person who, under the provisions of the Indian Majority Act, 1875 (9 of 1875 ); is
            deemed not to have attained his majority;</p>
        <p>(b) ” wife” includes a woman who has been divorced by, or has obtained a divorce from, her husband and has
            not remarried.</p>
        <p><strong>(2)</strong> Such allowance shall be payable from the date of the order, or, if so ordered, from the
            date of the application for maintenance.</p>
        <p><strong>(3)</strong> If any person so ordered fails without sufficient cause to comply with the order, any
            such Magistrate may, for every breach of the order, issue a warrant for levying the amount due in the manner
            provided for levying fines, and may sentence such person, for the whole or any part of each month’ s
            allowances remaining unpaid after the execution of the warrant, to imprisonment for a term which may extend
            to one month or until payment if sooner made: Provided that no warrant shall be issued for the recovery of
            any amount due under this section unless application be made to the Court to levy such amount within a
            period of one year from the date on which it became due: Provided further that if such person offers to
            maintain his wife on condition of her living with him, and she refuses to live with him, such</p>
        <p>Magistrate may consider any grounds of refusal stated by her, and may make an order under this section
            notwithstanding such offer, if he is satisfied that there is just ground for so doing. Explanation.- If a
            husband has contracted marriage with another woman or keeps a mistress, it shall be considered to be just
            ground for his wife’ s refusal to live with him.</p>
        <p><strong>(4)</strong> No Wife shall be entitled to receive an allowance from her husband under this section if
            she is living in adultery, or if, without any sufficient reason, she refuses to live with her husband, or if
            they are living separately by mutual consent.</p>
        <p><strong>(5)</strong> On proof that any wife in whose favour an order has been made under this section is
            living in adultery, or that without sufficient reason she refuses to live with her husband, or that they are
            living separately by mutual consent, the Magistrate shall cancel the order.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The US has reaffirmed its support to India’s membership bid to the Nuclear Suppliers Group and said it
                has called on other members of the elite grouping to back New Delhi’s application.
            </li>
            <li>India has applied for the membership of the 48-member Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) which controls
                international nuclear trade.
            </li>
            <li>The Department of Defence and Department of State in its report submitted to Congress as required under
                National Defence Authorisation Act (NDAA) 2017 also re-affirmed its support for India’s membership in
                the Australia Group and Wassenaar Arrangement as soon as India meets each group’s membership criteria.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Highlights of the report</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The US and India share a commitment to preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and
                their means of delivery.
            </li>
            <li>Since 2010, the US has supported India’s membership in the four multilateral export control regimes —
                Wassenaar Arrangement, NSG, Australia Group, and the Missile Technology Control Regime — as India
                prepared to take the steps required for membership in each one
            </li>
            <li>The US, the report said, welcomed India as a member of the Missile Technology Control Regime and its
                subscription to the Hague Code of Conduct Against Ballistic Missile Proliferation in June 2016.
            </li>
            <li>The report notes that the future leadership of <strong>Defence Technology and Trade Initiative
                (DTTI)</strong> will consist of an individual with experience in defence acquisition and technology to
                reinforce and ensure the success of the US-India Defence Relationship.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Defence partnership</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Since 2008, the US and India have concluded more than USD 15 billion in defence trade, including the
                transfer from the US to India of C-130J and C-17 transport aircraft, P-8I maritime patrol aircraft,
                Harpoon missiles, Apache and Chinook helicopters, and M777 light-weight Howitzers.
            </li>
            <li>India operates the second largest C-17 and P-8 fleets in the world, recently using its C-17s to deliver
                humanitarian assistance to Nepal and evacuate civilians from Yemen.
            </li>
            <li>The US had designated India a “Major Defence Partner” in June 2016 intending to elevate defence trade
                and technology sharing with India to a level commensurate with that of its closest allies and partners.
            </li>
            <li>In 2012, the US Department of Defence and India’s Ministry of Defence established the Defence Technology
                and Trade Initiative (DTTI) as a means of strengthening industrial cooperation and moving away from the
                traditional “buyer- seller” approach.

            </li>
            <li>Thousands of patients who couldn’t afford stents can now afford the devices at a fraction of the cost
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>What are Stents?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stents are tiny metal tubes coated with medication, which are inserted into clogged arteries to keep
                them flowing well.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>When it is used?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Emergency angioplasty is the treatment of choice during an acute heart attack, wherein the clot is
                crushed with a balloon and a stent is placed.
            </li>
            <li>It improves the chance of the patient surviving by almost 30 per cent when compared to clot dissolving
                medication (thrombolysis).
            </li>
            <li>However, in India, emergency angioplasty was carried out in less than 10 per cent of patients because of
                the cost involved in the procedure and the lack of access to stents.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Capping the prices- unintended ramifications on different sectors</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Health sector</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Preference for stenting even in cases when it is not the best treatment and disturbing increase in
                multi-vessel stenting.
            </li>
            <li>With cheaper stents and a fall in procedure costs, many more patients are opting for angioplasty.</li>
            <li>Patients with multiple blocks in all three vessels, open heart surgery is a better than the use of
                multiple stents. However, with lower stent prices, patients often choose multi-vessel angioplasty as it
                is cheaper than open heart surgery
            </li>
            <li>Even the latest drug-eluting stents get clogged in about 5 per cent of cases.</li>
            <li>With the increasing use of the tiny metal tubes, the chances of a stent blocking with consequent damage
                to the heart muscle will only increase.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Indigenous development of stents</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stent manufacturers typically spend millions of dollars on research before they can make the device and
                commercialise it.
            </li>
            <li>Abruptly reducing stent prices will have adverse effects on the development of improved stents.</li>
            <li>International companies may be able to offset their losses with profits in other markets, and from
                profits from other products
            </li>
            <li>Even before the price control move was instituted, only 40 per cent of the stents used in the country
                were indigenously manufactured; the rest were imported.
            </li>
            <li>With prices of imported stents and Indian stents now being the same, doctors and patients could prefer
                the imported devices
            </li>
            <li>All these will have a bearing on their capacity to do quality research.</li>
            <li>Lack of government funding for clinical research in India only aggravates the issue.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Internationally</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lack of indigenous research and development will make the country dependent on imported stents</li>
            <li>Multinational companies may choose not to release their latest products in India because of the
                country’s price control regime
            </li>
            <li>Such an alarming scenario might pertain not only to stent technology but also to research and marketing
                of other implantable devices.
            </li>
            <li>It end up with a situation where hospitals in the country would have older generation stents.</li>
            <li>Patients hoping to have advanced stents may have to travel abroad</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Medical tourism sector</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>It will become apparent that Indian hospitals do not have the latest generation stents.</li>
            <li>With time, paradoxically, patients who were the intended benefactors of this price control measure may
                actually turn out to be losers.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Way forward</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Encourage and support Indian stent manufacturers and medical device research so that we do no need to
                depend on imported stents.
            </li>
            <li>All aspects involving medical device development (clinical research, animal testing, and human trials)
                must be fast-tracked and should be as transparent as possible.
            </li>
            <li>There must be a system to make sure that the latest medical devices, including stents, are priced
                differently.
            </li>
            <li>Once such a level of competency is achieved, India could actually export stents, making “Make in India”
                viable for medical devices.
            </li>

            class="external">Union Cabinet clears minimum wage code bill</a></strong></span></p>
    <div id="Union">
        <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Union Cabinet approved the new wage code bill which will ensure a minimum wage across all sectors by
                integrating four labour related laws.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The new wage code</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Labour Code on Wages Bill will consolidate the Minimum Wages Act, 1948; the Payment of Wages Act,
                1936; the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965; and the Equal Remuneration Act, 1976.
            </li>
            <li>The bill seeks to empower the Centre to set a minimum wage across all sectors in the country and states
                will have to maintain that.
            </li>
            <li>However, states will be able to provide for higher minimum wage in their jurisdiction than fixed by the
                central government
            </li>
            <li>The new minimum wage norms would be applicable for all workers irrespective of their pay.</li>
            <li>At present, the minimum wages fixed by the Centre and states are applicable to workers getting up to Rs
                18,000 pay monthly.
            </li>
            <li>This would ensure a universal minimum wage for all industries and workers, including those getting
                monthly pay higher than Rs 18,000
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Second National Commission on Labour</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>It has recommended that the existing labour laws should be broadly grouped into four or five labour
                codes on functional basis.
            </li>
            <li>Accordingly, ministry has taken steps for drafting four Labour Codes on — Wages; Industrial Relations;
                Social Security &amp; Welfare and Safety and Working Conditions, respectively.
            </li>
            <li>It will be done by simplifying, amalgamating and rationalising the relevant provisions of the existing
                central labour laws.

            </li>

        <p><strong>Concerns of RCEP Members</strong></p>
        <ul>

                jobs for locals

                <li>Do you consider the practice of dowry as unethical and immoral? Justify your answer.</li>
                <li>You are a no-nonsense, honest officer. You have been transferred to a remote district to head a
                    department that is notorious for its inefficiency and callousness. You find that the main cause of
                    the poor state of affairs is the indiscipline of a section of employees. They do not work themselves
                    and also disrupt the working of others. You first warned the troublemakers to mend their ways or
                    else face disciplinary action. When the warning had little effect, you issued a show cause notice to
                    the ringleaders. As a retaliatory measure, these troublemakers instigated a woman employee amongst
                    them to file a complaint of sexual harassment against you with the Women’s Commission. The
                    Commission promptly seeks your explanation. The matter is also publicized in the media to embarrass
                    you further. Some of the options to handle this situation could be as follows:
                </li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <li>Give your explanation to the Commission and go soft on the disciplinary action.</li>
                <li>Ignore the Commission and proceed firmly with the disciplinary action.</li>
                <li>Brief your higher-ups, seek directions from them and act accordingly.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Suggest any other possible option(s). Evaluate all of them and suggest the best course of action, giving
                your reasons for it.</p>

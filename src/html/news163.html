                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Five-judge Constitution Bench</strong> hearing a batch of nine appeals filed by the
                        Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party government against an August 4, 2016 judgment of the Delhi
                        High Court.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Controversy</strong> : proviso <strong>to Article 239AA (4),</strong> which mandates
                        that in case of a difference of opinion between the LG and the Council of Ministers, the former
                        has to refer the issue to the President. In the meanwhile, while that decision is pending before
                        the President, the LG, if the matter is urgent, can use his discretion to take immediate action.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>High Court order:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It declared the LG to have “complete control of all matters regarding National Capital Territory
                        of Delhi, and nothing will happen without the concurrence of the LG.”
                    </li>
                    <li>LG has special powers greater than the President, greater than other Governors of States.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>What the government is expecting?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Kejriwal government wants the Supreme Court to lay down the law on whether the LG can
                        unilaterally administer the National Capital without being bound by the “aid and advice” of the
                        elected government.
                    </li>

                <p><strong>Justice D.Y. Chandrachud oral observations regarding the role of The Lieutenant
                    Governor:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Lieutenant Governor (LG) of Delhi cannot stultify proposals or schemes forwarded by the
                        Council of Ministers to him by simply sitting on them.
                    </li>
                    <li>The LG is bound to pass the difference of opinions [between the LG and the Delhi Council of
                        Ministers] to the President for early resolution.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Constitutional Status:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <strong>69th Amendment of the Constitution in 1992</strong> gave the National Capital of
                        Delhi special status with its own democratically elected government and legislative assembly.
                    </li>
                    <li>Sub-section (4) of <strong>Article 239AA</strong> mandates that a Council of Ministers shall aid
                        and advice the LG in his functions regarding laws made by the Legislative Assembly.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Various opinions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Constitution Bench, led by <strong>Chief Justice Dipak Misra</strong>, prima facie said that
                        the Delhi government’s ability to <strong>“aid and advice”</strong> the LG is limited to
                        subjects other than public order, police and land in the National Capital. It said that the
                        proviso to Article 239AA (4), on plain reading, seems to give primacy to the LG.
                    </li>
                    <li>Justice Ashok Bhushan remarked that the LG is entitled to take a different view and is not bound
                        by the aid and advice of the Delhi Cabinet.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Counter arguments:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Subramanium alleged that the LG has misused the discretion in this proviso to block governance
                        to such an extent that decisions from appointment of teachers in municipal schools to opening of
                        mohalla clinics have been pending for over a year.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Chief Secretary and other officers, without applying their minds to the various welfare
                        proposals and schemes, simply forward the files to the LG, where it remains indeterminately.
                    </li>
                    <li>The “extraordinary discretion” of the LG is confined to special circumstances and not in
                        everything.
                    </li>

                <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The government will soon constitute the <strong>Fifteenth Finance Commission</strong>, as per
                        normal practice, a couple of years before the end of the five-year period during which the
                        Commission’s recommendations are valid.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Constitutions provisions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Article 280 of the Constitution requires that a Finance Commission be constituted to recommend
                        the distribution of the net proceeds of taxes between the Centre and states, and among the
                        states.
                    </li>
                    <li>The framers of the Constitution were seeking to address the vertical imbalance between the
                        taxation powers and expenditure and responsibilities of the federal government and the states,
                        and the horizontal imbalance, or inequality, between states that were at different stages of
                        development.
                    </li>
                    <li>Ensuring inclusiveness is, therefore, a key mandate of the Finance Commission.</li>
                    <li>That means assigning weights to things like population, the fiscal distance between the top
                        ranked states and the others, etc. <strong>It is not that the best-performing state will be
                            allocated the highest share </strong>– even if delivery execution and governance are better
                        – rather, the effort will be to narrow the development gap between states.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The Finance Commission Rules, 1951,</strong> lay down the criteria for being members of
                        the constitutional body: those having special knowledge of finance and accounts of government
                        with wide knowledge and experience in financial matters and in administration, or with special
                        knowledge of economics, and those who have been qualified to be appointed as a judge of a High
                        Court.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Challenges ahead:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>As the Fifteenth Commission is set to be appointed, the criteria for distribution will be
                        reviewed.
                    </li>
                    <li>The question is whether the commission will take into account the level of collections by each
                        state after the roll out of the GST or not?
                    </li>
                    <li>The challenge this time will be the fact that unlike in the past, the share of net tax proceeds
                        between the central government and states is almost equal.
                    </li>
                    <li>After the last Commission’s recommendation to distribute 42%, raising the bar on higher transfer
                        of resources will have a much bigger impact on the federal government.
                    </li>
                    <li>The twelfth Finance Commission had suggested that it was time now to perhaps look at a
                        Constitutional amendment to fix a ceiling on the distribution of the net tax proceeds, with the
                        Finance Commission arbitrating on distributing tax proceeds among states.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Commission itself reckons that its biggest role has been to uphold the country’s federal
                        structure, and to be an architect of fiscal restructuring – from being mainly an arbitrator
                        between the Centre and states.

                            <li>India hit out at double standards in the war on terrorism, hours after China blocked a

                                chief of the Jaish-e-Mohammed, in a list of global terrorists.

                <ul>
                    <li>The US fell to 49th among the 144 countries ranked, down from 45th last year and 23rd just 11
                        years ago. The country is only 77% of the way to gender parity in economic opportunity, a gap
                        that’s been narrowing, but not as quickly as in other countries.
                    </li>
                    <li>India, which sank to No. 108 overall, down 10 places from 2006 was the reverse of the US, with
                        high rankings for women’s political empowerment but near the bottom in health, education and
                        economic participation. Economics is a particular area of concern, because women do a

                        average, compared with a global average of five years. While about 70 percent of Chinese women
                        participate in the work force, they earn only 64% of men’s wages.

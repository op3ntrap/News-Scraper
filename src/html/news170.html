            <ul>
                <li>Originally constructed in the early 1400s, the Forbidden City is considered to be among the most
                    important architectural and cultural monuments inside China. Designed to reflect the majesty of the
                    emperor, the vast walled complex consists of over 90 palaces and courtyards of varying significance.

                <li>The Forbidden City is a palace complex in central Beijing</li>
                <li>The Forbidden City served as the home of emperors and their households as well as the ceremonial and
                    political center of Chinese government for almost 500 years.
                </li>
                <li>The Forbidden City was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987, and is listed by UNESCO as the
                    largest collection of preserved ancient wooden structures in the world.

            <ul>
                <li>The Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura (IPFT) has long been campaigning for a separate Twipraland
                    for tribals by carving out the Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong> </strong><strong>Tipraland</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is the name of a proposed state in India, <strong>proposed by the Tipra people of
                    Tripura</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>The Twipra Kingdom is a former country which was ruled by 184 Tripuri/Tipra kings. The last king was
                    <strong>Maharaja Bir Bikram Kishore Manikya Bahadur Debbarma</strong>. After his death in 1946,
                    Twipra kingdom joined India as a Union Territory on 15 October 1949 under the name Tripura, and
                    later achieved statehood.
                </li>
                <li>From that time onwards many <strong>Bengali Hindus and Muslims immigrated to Tripura</strong>, and
                    slowly took political power from the Tipras. As the political and economic power shifted to the
                    immigrants, the very existence of the Tipra people and their culture was jeopardized.
                </li>
                <li>The indigenous <strong>Tipra people demanded an autonomous district</strong>, which they finally
                    achieved on 23 March 1979. However, the <strong>Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council
                        (TTAADC)</strong> was unable to protect the rights of the indigenous Tipra and other tribal
                    communities.
                </li>
                <li>The Tipra people feel it has become clear that without full governmental power, <strong>the
                    indigenous Tipra people cannot survive. </strong>Thus the Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura, a
                    regional political party under the leadership of N.C. Debbarma, has advocated for converting the
                    TTAADC area into a full-fledged state.

            <ul>
                <li>The Rajasthan High Court restrained the government from implementing the provisions of a Bill passed
                    in the State Assembly, by which it increased reservation for the Other Backward Classes (OBC) from
                    21% to 26%.
                </li>
                <li>The Bill, passed created the <strong>“most backward” category</strong> within the OBCs for providing
                    reservation to Gujjars and four other nomadic communities in government employment and educational
                    institutions.

                    Appointment and Posts in Services under the State) Bill, 2017, gave 5% reservation to the Gujjar,
                    Banjara, Gadia-Lohar, Raika and Gadariya communities.
                </li>
                <li>With its passage, reservation in Rajasthan stood at 54%, exceeding the 50% ceiling mandated by the
                    Supreme Court.

            <ul>
                <li>The State government has maintained that as per the Supreme Court’s ruling in the <em>Indra
                    Sawhney</em>case, special circumstances exist in Rajasthan for giving reservation to the OBCs beyond
                    the 50% ceiling.
                </li>
                <li>The State OBC Commission has recommended quota to the communities classified as OBCs, which comprise
                    52% of the State’s population.

        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>The Supreme Court said, “the reservations contemplated in clause (4) of Article 16 should not exceed 50
                per cent. While 50 per cent shall be the rule, it is necessary not to put off consideration of certain
                extra-ordinary situations inherent in the great diversity of this country and the people. It might
                happen that in far-flung and remote areas, the population inhabiting those areas might, on account of
                their <strong>being out of the mainstream of national life and in view of the conditions

                    relaxation in this strict rule may become imperative.</strong> In doing so, <strong>extreme caution
                    is to be exercised and a special case made out</strong>.”

                <li>It is set to tighten the noose on players who, authorities believe, have started splitting their

                <li>The Council is also set to cut tax rates on a large number of product lines.</li>
                <li>The Council is expected to further liberalise the Composition Scheme for small businesses and
                    traders to pay a flat and low tax on their turnover.

                <li>The annual turnover eligibility threshold is likely to be raised to ₹1.5 crore from the Rs.1 crore

                <li>The objective of composition scheme is to bring simplicity and to reduce the compliance cost for the
                    small taxpayers. Moreover, it is optional and the eligible person opting to pay tax under this
                    scheme can pay tax at a prescribed percentage of his turnover every quarter, instead of paying tax
                    at normal rate.

                </li>
                <li>The dealer cannot supply GST exempted goods</li>
                <li>Taxpayer has to pay tax at normal rates for transactions under Reverse Charge Mechanism</li>
                <li>If a taxable person has different segments of businesses (such as textile, electronic accessories,
                    groceries, etc.) under the same PAN, they must register all such businesses under the scheme
                    collectively or opt out of the scheme
                </li>
                <li>The taxpayer has to mention the words ‘composition taxable person’ on every notice or signboard
                    displayed prominently at their place of business

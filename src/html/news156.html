                        available along the coast of Krishna and Guntur districts.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Geological Survey of India has confirmed the presence of beach sand minerals —<strong>ilmenite,
                        rutile, zircon, garnet and silliminate</strong> — on the coastline of the two districts and its
                        feasibility is under study.
                    </li>
                    <li>In beach sand mining, the sand collected from the beach is dumped in the same area after
                        extracting the minerals without leading to any adverse impact on the coast.

                <p><strong>Vulnerable witnesses deposition centres:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Supreme Court observation</strong>: Vulnerable witnesses in criminal cases, often minor
                        survivors of rape or victims of sex abuse, should testify without fear or intimidation in a
                        conducive environment.
                    </li>
                    <li>Concerned at the trauma these victims of crime face in conventional courtrooms, the Supreme
                        Court has ordered the setting up of at least two vulnerable witnesses deposition centres in the
                        jurisdiction of every High Court across the country within the next three months.
                    </li>
                    <li>The order upholds the right of vulnerable witnesses to be protected while testifying in court
                        and is in consonance with international norms in these matters.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The case of vulnerable victims:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Vulnerable witnesses are often treated like any other witness of the State in a criminal
                        trial.
                    </li>
                    <li>Victims often end up being ill-treated by the very system they had approached in the hope of
                        justice.
                    </li>
                    <li>Delay and intimidating questions during trial in a hostile environment lead to fewer
                        convictions.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Guidelines for Recording the Evidence of Vulnerable Witnesses in Criminal Matters</strong>:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Supreme Court suggested that other high courts should adopt the Delhi HC’s ‘Guidelines for
                        Recording the Evidence of Vulnerable Witnesses in Criminal Matters,’ with required
                        modifications.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Delhi HC’s guidelines are filtered from the best practices followed by other countries and
                        the police and precedents of the apex court and high courts.
                    </li>
                    <li>The practices include a screen or some arrangement by which the victim does not see the body or
                        face of the accused; reducing cross-examination questions to writing and handing them over to
                        the judge to be put to the victim in a language that is clear and not embarrassing; and
                        sufficient breaks for victims of child abuse or rape while testifying.

                        India’</strong>, submitted to the Law Ministry, by the Law Commission of India.

                </ul>
                <p><strong>Law commission of India recommendations:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Key Fact:</strong> the disposal rate of the tribunals in comparison to the filing of
                        cases per year had been remarkable — 94% — the pendency remains high.
                    </li>
                    <li>Appointments to tribunals and their functioning should remain independent of the executive’s
                        influence
                    </li>
                    <li>A Committee led by the Chief Justice of India should be in charge of the appointments of
                        Chairman, Vice-Chairman and Judicial Members of the various central tribunals, which form a
                        pillar of the country’s justice delivery system.
                    </li>
                    <li>Every order emanating from the tribunal or its appellate forum, wherever it exists, attains
                        finality
                    </li>
                    <li>Reappointment of chairman and others compromises the independence and fairness of the
                        tribunal.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Commission has suggested a <strong>common nodal agency</strong>, possibly under the Law
                        Ministry, to both monitor the working of the tribunals and to ensure uniformity in the
                        appointment, tenure and service conditions for the Chairman, Vice-Chairman and members.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Present context:</strong> As of now, tribunals function under the very government
                        department which may be a litigant before them, and probably, against which they may have to
                        pass orders.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>HC power to review</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a marked departure from its earlier stand, the Commission recommended the restoration of the
                        High Courts’ power of judicial review over the decisions of the tribunals.
                    </li>
                    <li>It said parties should be allowed to challenge a tribunal order before the Division Bench of the
                        high court having territorial jurisdiction over the tribunal or its appellate forum.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Present Context:</strong> Presently, parties are deprived of an opportunity to move high
                        courts concerned against the orders of some tribunals and have to move the Supreme Court
                        directly.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Location of the Tribunal:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Commission said tribunals must have benches in different parts of the country so that people
                        of every geographical area may have easy access to justice
                    </li>
                    <li>Ideally, the benches of the tribunals should be located at all places where the high courts
                        situate. In the event of exclusion of jurisdiction of all courts, it is essential to provide for
                        an equally effective alternative mechanism even at grass root level. This could be ensured by
                        providing State- level sittings looking to the quantum of work of a particular tribunal. Once
                        that is done, the access to justice will stand ensured.
                    </li>

                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>High courts:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For the framers of our Constitution, high courts, occupied a central position</li>
                        <li>They were conceived as a forum for adjudicating disputes under the Constitution, Central and
                            State statutes before they moved to the Supreme Court
                        </li>
                        <li>HC’s jurisdiction was more extensive than the SC’s</li>
                        <li>Parliament has inflicted damage on high courts with rampant tribunalisation</li>
                        <li>Tribunals have replaced high courts for disputes under the Companies Act, Competition Act,
                            SEBI Act, Electricity Act, Consumer Protection Act among others
                        </li>

                        </li>
                        <li>Three main issues related to rampant Tribunalisation</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>First: </strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>These tribunals do not enjoy the same constitutional protection as high courts</li>
                        <li>The appointment process and service conditions of high court judges are not under the
                            control of the executive
                        </li>
                        <li>The enormous institutional investment to protect the independence of high courts is
                            dispensed with when it comes to tribunals
                        </li>
                        <li>Many tribunals still owe allegiance to their parent ministries</li>
                        <li>Tribunals are also not as accessible as high courts</li>
                        <li>For example, there are just four benches of the Green Tribunal for the whole country</li>
                        <li>In comparison, high courts were easily accessible for environmental matters</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Second:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Conferring a direct right of appeal to the Supreme Court from tribunals has changed the
                            Supreme Court from being a constitutional court to a mere appellate court
                        </li>
                        <li>It has become a final clearing house for every appeal under every statute</li>
                        <li>The Supreme Court should be a court of last resort deciding cases of the moment, and not a
                            final forum with an all-embracing jurisdiction over disputes ranging from a custody battle
                            to the scope of a municipal by-law
                        </li>
                        <li>If high courts were to exercise appellate jurisdiction over orders of tribunals, they would
                            act as filters
                        </li>
                        <li>Enabling the Supreme Court to confine itself to those substantial questions where there is
                            divergence among high courts
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Third: </strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The high courts are the training grounds for future SC judges</li>
                        <li>When high court judges deal with several cases under a particular area of law, they carry
                            with them the benefit of their experience and insights to the SC
                        </li>
                        <li>When high courts are side-stepped in favour of tribunals, Supreme Court judges hearing
                            appeals from tribunals would have to deal with the finer nuances of disputes under
                            specialised areas of law for the very first time
                        </li>
                        <li>This is not ideal for a court of last resort</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Original jurisdiction of the SC</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The jurisdiction of high courts is also undermined by the SC when it directly entertains
                            various writ petitions
                        </li>
                        <li>When the Supreme Court exercises original jurisdiction, it deprives the citizen and the
                            state of the right to challenge potentially erroneous orders
                        </li>
                        <li>A classic instance is the Supreme Court’s ruling in the 2G case</li>
                        <li>To overcome this ruling, the President had to invoke the advisory jurisdiction of the SC
                        </li>
                        <li>The ordinary citizen enjoys no such privilege</li>
                        <li>This difficulty becomes even more acute when the SC takes on a legislative role by framing
                            guidelines in the larger public interest
                        </li>
                        <li>Neither the individual nor the state has an effective remedy to challenge these norms</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>The way forward</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It has been asserted that when the Supreme Court decides an issue, it avoids conflicting
                            judgments of the high court
                        </li>
                        <li>This is untrue. The SC is in a better position to resolve a dispute when it is confronted
                            with two conflicting high court rulings on the same issue
                        </li>
                        <li>If high courts lose their prominence, India’s justice delivery system will be the principal
                            loser
                        </li>

                        </li>
                        <li>The transfer was part of India’s commitment to send <strong>1 million tonnes </strong>of

                        <li>The move is significant as it indicates India remains firm in delivering on its <strong>regional

                <ul>
                    <li>The Supreme Court requested all States and Union Territories to move forward towards a
                        nationwide ban on the use of pet coke and furnace oil to power up industries, in a bid to fight
                        pollution.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Environment Bench of the Supreme Court had already ordered a ban on the industrial use of
                        pet coke and furnace oil in the States of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan on October 24.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Why ban?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This ban specifically came after an Environment Pollution Control Authority Report recommended
                        the ban on sale, distribution and use of furnace oil and pet coke in the National Capital Region
                        (NCR). Their use is already prohibited in Delhi.
                    </li>
                    <li>On October 24, the apex court also imposed a fine of ₹2 lakh on the Ministry of Environment for
                        not fixing any emission standards for industries using pet coke and furnace oil in the NCR.

                    <li>Bringing relief to millions of Non Resident Indians (NRIs), Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) and
                        Overseas Citizens of India (OCIs), the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has said
                        that Aadhaar as an identity document should be sought only from those who are eligible for the
                        unique ID as per the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and
                        Services) Act, 2016.
                    </li>
                    <li>This means that government agencies can now exempt those belonging to these categories from
                        furnishing Aadhaar identity for availing services as they are not eligible for enrolling for the
                        unique ID.
                    </li>
                    <li>The circular stated that the Prevention of Money Laundering (Maintenance of Records) Rules, 2017
                        and the Income Tax Act, 1961 clearly stipulate that the linking of Bank Accounts and PAN
                        respectively is for those persons who are eligible to enrol for Aadhaar as per the Aadhaar Act,
                        2016.
                    </li>
                    <li>And individuals who were not assigned Aadhaar numbers shall be offered alternate and viable
                        means of delivery of subsidy, benefit or service.
                    </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>What made the situation tricky for NRIs, PIOs and OCIs is that the Act as it stands today,
                        allows only “residents” of India to enroll for the unique identity.
                    </li>
                    <li>The circular said the UIDAI had received several representations from these sections, informing
                        about difficulties faced by them as various authorities demanded Aadhaar from them in respect of
                        various services/benefits etc like maintaining existing NRE and NRO bank accounts and appearance
                        by students in different exams in India.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The Aadhar Act, 2016</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Act says every resident shall be entitled to obtain an Aadhaar number by submitting his
                        demographic information and biometric information by undergoing the process of enrolment.
                    </li>
                    <li>Who is a resident is further defined as an individual who has resided in India for a period or
                        periods amounting in all to one hundred and eighty-two days or more in the twelve months
                        immediately preceding the date of application for enrolment.

                        <li>Global credit rating agency Moody’s Investors Services raised India’s sovereign rating for
                            the first time in 13 years, citing the country’s high growth potential in the years to come,
                            thanks to economic and institutional reforms.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Main inference: The continued progress on economic and institutional reforms
                            will,</strong> over time, enhance India’s high growth potential and its large and stable
                            financing base for government debt, and will likely contribute to a gradual decline in the
                            general government debt burden over the medium term.

                        </li>
                        <li>Borrowing obligations rated Baa2 are subject to moderate credit risk. They are considered
                            medium grade and as such may possess certain speculative characteristics.

                    <p>Rating agency Moody’s upgraded India’s sovereign rating after a gap of almost 14 years</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The attention is now on the other two global rating agencies, Standard &amp; Poor’s and
                            Fitch Ratings
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Chief Economic Advisor’s views</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian hopes that rating agencies might not be
                            inconsistent amongst each other
                        </li>
                        <li>Subramanian had earlier observed that ratings agencies followed inconsistent policies while
                            rating India as opposed to awarding ratings to China
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>S&amp;P’s view about the upgrade</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In October, S&amp;P had said the country needed to improve its fiscal position for a rating
                            upgrade
                        </li>
                        <li>For an upgrade, India would have to address its weak fiscal balance sheet and weak fiscal
                            performance
                        </li>
                        <li>India has one of the highest general government debt-to-GDP levels (68%) among emerging
                            market sovereigns
                        </li>
                        <li>A potential rating upgrade is likely to come from improved fiscal performance</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Government’s limitations</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Year after year, the fiscal deficit remains relatively large with the interest burden and
                            subsidies taking a big chunk of government spending
                        </li>
                        <li>So there’s not a lot of room for the government to maneuver, despite pressing infrastructure
                            needs
                        </li>

                            <li>Until now, public and private industries have only supplied devices, components and
                                sub-systems for ISRO’s launch vehicles, including the PSLV and the GSLV

                            <li>ISRO already has a partnership with private industry to produce satellites</li>
                            <li>The IRNSS-1H communication satellite aboard the ill-fated PSLV C-39 was the first to be

                            <li>ISRO had a partnership with about 500 domestic industries for the supply of various

                            <ul>
                                <li>Besides stubble burning, a “multi-day dust storm” in Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia
                                    was the main cause of Delhi’s smog between November 6 and 14.
                                </li>
                                <li>According to a study by the System of Air Quality And Weather Forecasting And
                                    Research (under the Ministry of Earth Sciences) and India Meteorological Department
                                    (IMD).
                                </li>

                            <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>There was a large multi-day dust storm that emerged in Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia
                                    in the last week of October 2017 and continued up to November 3 and 4. This dust
                                    storm was carried by relatively cool winds.
                                </li>
                                <li>Winds at a height and low wind speed close to the surface meant that the pollutants
                                    were carried towards Delhi.
                                </li>
                                <li>Also, stubble burning in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana was very high on November
                                    6 and upper-air winds became North Westerly (towards Delhi) with high speed and
                                    started pumping pollution in Delhi.
                                </li>
                                <li>The study says that the dust storm was responsible for 40 percent of the pollution
                                    on November 8, when the average air quality index was 478, indicating “severe”
                                    levels of pollution.
                                </li>
                                <li>While stubble burning was responsible for 25 percent of the pollution, “local
                                    sources” also played a role.
                                </li>

                                <li>According to the study, if external sources had not affected air quality, the
                                    average concentration of PM 2.5 would have been about 200micrograms per cubic meter
                                    instead of 640 micrograms per cubic meter

                                    winds, cool temperature, inversion layer trapped pollution within Delhi territory.

                                    a ban on construction and entry of trucks in Delhi made a positive difference of
                                    around 15 percent

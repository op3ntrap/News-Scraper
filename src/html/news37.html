                </li>
                <li>Whereas in rural areas nuclear families are rising and joint families declining at a faster pace
                    than in urban areas.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Reasons</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lack of adequate housing in urban areas forcing people to stay together</li>

                <li>Sub-nuclear family: It is a fragment of a nuclear family, such as a widow with unmarried children,
                    or siblings living together.
                </li>

                </li>
                <li>Broken extended nuclear families: Comprise a head without a spouse with other relations, of whom

                <li>The Supreme Court questioned the Election Commission on its reluctance to use <strong>voter
                    verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT)</strong> units with electronic voting machines for the Gujarat
                    Assembly polls in 2017, warning the poll panel against making excuses and compelling the court to
                    force its hand.

            <p><strong>Petition:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Filed by Mohit Singh, represented by counsel Kapil Sibal.</li>
                <li>Plea to direct the commission to implement the VVPAT voting mechanism in the Gujarat polls or
                    otherwise use ballot papers to ensure a transparent, free and fair election.
                </li>
                <li>Gujarat High Court dismissed it.</li>
                <li><strong>Supreme Court’s 2013 judgment in Subramanian Swamy vs Election Commission of India</strong>
                </li>
                <li>Court’s observation: “paper trail is an indispensable requirement of <strong>free and fair
                    elections.</strong> The confidence of the voters in the EVMs can be achieved only with the
                    introduction of the “paper trail”. <strong>EVMs with VVPAT system ensure the accuracy of the voting
                        system.”</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>VVPAT and fair elections: </strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The execution of the VVPAT concept would result in printed receipts of what party the EVM machine
                    has registered a vote for.
                </li>
                <li>The said printed receipts would then ideally be collected by the voters and subsequently dropped in
                    a ballot box.
                </li>
                <li>Therefore, the votes registered in the EVM may then be tallied with the ballot papers collected in
                    the ballot box, thus, allowing the commission to ascertain whether a recount is required or not.
                </li>
                <li>Such printed receipts ensure that the voting is carried out in a more transparent fashion and
                    further inspiring confidence in the election process.

                <li>The Constitution (123rd Amendment) Bill, 2017 was introduced in Lok Sabha by the Minister of Social

            <ul>
                <li>The government has decided to do away with the no-detention policy for students from the next
                    academic session.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What does the law say?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Under the Right to Education Act, 2009, no child admitted to a school will be held back in any class
                    or expelled till the completion of elementary education covering Classes 1 to 8.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why such a move?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The decision was taken following representation from most of the States as they said the <strong>standard
                    of education had deteriorated</strong> because of the policy.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What is the no-detention policy?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>No student up to Class VIII can be detained or failed. All students up to Class VIII are
                    automatically promoted to the next class.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>When were these implemented? Why?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The no-detention policy was implemented as part of the Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE)
                    under the RTE Act in 2010 to ensure holistic development of students. The idea was also to reduce
                    dropout rates. Several states already had no-detention policies. Continuous and Comprehensive
                    Evaluation emphasises on evaluating a child through the year, and not just based on performance in
                    one or two term exams.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What is wrong with the no-fail policy?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A section of teachers and parents have complained that this policy has led to students developing a
                    lackadaisical attitude, with there being no risk of failing. They also say this system makes no
                    distinction between good and bad students, and between those who work hard and those who don’t. Some
                    states have demanded revocation of the policy, claiming this has led to a sharp fall in learning
                    outcomes and academic levels.

            <ul>
                <li>2014 Supreme court judgment in the <strong>Animal Welfare Board of India vs. A. Nagaraja and
                    others</strong>: banned jallikattu as cruelty and held it violative of Sections 3 and 11 of the
                    Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960.
                </li>
                <li>The People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) moved the Supreme Court for quashing the <strong>Prevention
                    of Cruelty to Animals (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act 2017 and the Tamil Nadu Prevention of Cruelty to
                    Animals (Conduct of Jallikattu) Rules, 2017.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Tamil Nadu:</strong> brought bulls back into the fold of ‘performing animals’ and opened the
                    gates for the conduct of the popular bull-taming sport in the name of <strong>culture and
                        tradition</strong> despite a 2014 ban by the Supreme Court.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>PETA’s contention in the petition filed:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Jallikattu abuse:</strong> events lead to severe injuries, including broken bones, and even
                    the death of humans and bulls.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Jallikattu Act and Rules violate the five internationally recognised freedoms</strong> – the
                    freedom from hunger, malnutrition and thirst; freedom from fear and distress; freedom from physical
                    and thermal discomfort; freedom from pain, injury and disease; and freedom to express normal
                    patterns of behaviour.

                        <li>The Constitution (Eighty-sixth Amendment) Act, 2002 inserted Article 21-A in the
                            Constitution of India to provide free and compulsory education of all children in the age
                            group of six to fourteen years as a Fundamental Right in such a manner as the State may, by
                            law, determine.
                        </li>
                        <li>The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, which represents the
                            consequential legislation envisaged under Article 21-A, means that every child has a right
                            to full time elementary education of satisfactory and equitable quality in a formal school
                            which satisfies certain essential norms and standards.
                        </li>
                        <li>The title of the RTE Act incorporates the words ‘free and compulsory’. ‘Free education’
                            means that no child, other than a child who has been admitted by his or her parents to a
                            school which is not supported by the appropriate Government, shall be liable to pay any kind
                            of fee or charges or expenses which may prevent him or her from pursuing and completing

                        <li>‘Compulsory education’ casts an obligation on the appropriate Government and local

                            education by all children in the 6-14 age group

                            of elementary education to every child in the six to fourteen age group. ‘Free’ means that
                            no child shall be liable to pay any kind of fee or charges or expenses which may prevent him
                            or her from pursuing and completing elementary education.

                        </li>
                        <li>It specifies the duties and responsibilities of appropriate Governments, local authority and
                            parents in providing free and compulsory education, and sharing of financial and other
                            responsibilities between the Central and State Governments.

                        </li>
                        <li>It provides for rational deployment of teachers by ensuring that the specified pupil teacher
                            ratio is maintained for each school, rather than just as an average for the State or
                            District or Block, thus ensuring that there is no urban-rural imbalance in teacher postings.
                            It also provides for prohibition of deployment of teachers for non-educational work, other
                            than decennial census, elections to local authority, state legislatures and parliament, and

                        <li>The Constitution (123rd Amendment) Bill, 2017 was introduced in Lok Sabha by the Minister of
                            Social Justice and Empowerment, Mr. Thaawarchand Gehlot on April 5, 2017. It seeks to grant
                            the National Commission on Backward Classes (NCBC) constitutional status, at par with the
                            National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) and the National Commission for Scheduled
                            Tribes.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Role of NCSC:</strong> Currently, under the Constitution the NCSC has the power to
                            look into complaints and welfare measures with regard to Scheduled Castes, backward classes
                            and Anglo-Indians.  The Bill seeks to remove the power of the NCSC to examine matters
                            related to backward classes.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Constitutional status to National Commission for Backward Classes: </strong>The NCBC
                            is a body set up under the National Commission for Backward Classes Act, 1993.  It has the
                            power to examine complaints regarding inclusion or exclusion of groups within the list of
                            backward classes, and advise the central government in this regard.  The Bill seeks to
                            establish the NCBC under the Constitution, and provide it the authority to examine
                            complaints and welfare measures regarding socially and educationally backward classes.
                        </li>
                        <li>Note that this Bill was introduced alongside the National Commission for Backward Classes
                            (Repeal) Bill, 2017 that seeks to repeal the National Commission for Backward Classes Act,
                            1993.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Backward classes:</strong> The Constitution Amendment Bill states that the President
                            may specify the socially and educationally backward classes in the various states and union
                            territories.  He may do this in consultation with the Governor of the concerned state. 
                            However, a law of Parliament will be required if the list of backward classes is to be
                            amended.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Composition and service conditions:</strong> Under the Constitution Amendment Bill,
                            the NCBC will comprise of five members appointed by the President.  Their tenure and
                            conditions of service will also be decided by the President through rules.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Functions:</strong> Under the Constitution Amendment Bill, the duties of the NCBC
                            will include: (i) investigating and monitoring how safeguards provided to the backward
                            classes under the Constitution and other laws are being implemented, (ii) inquiring into
                            specific complaints regarding violation of rights, and (iii) advising and making
                            recommendations on socio-economic development of such classes.  The central and state
                            governments will be required to consult with the NCBC on all major policy matters affecting
                            the socially and educationally backward classes.
                        </li>
                        <li>The NCBC will be required to present annual reports to the President on working of the
                            safeguards for backward classes. These reports will be tabled in Parliament, and in the
                            state legislative assemblies of the concerned states.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Powers of a civil court</strong>: Under the Constitution Amendment Bill, the NCBC
                            will have the powers of a civil court while investigating or inquiring into any complaints. 
                            These powers include: (i) summoning people and examining them on oath, (ii) requiring
                            production of any document or public record, and (iii) receiving evidence.

                    <p>Explanation:</p>
                    <p>The Coriolis effect influences the paths of moving objects on Earth and is caused by Earth s
                        rotation. Because Earths surface rotates at different velocities at different latitudes, objects
                        in motion tend to veer to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern
                        Hemisphere. The Coriolis effect is nonexistent at the equator but increases with latitude,
                        reaching a maximum at the poles.</p></div>

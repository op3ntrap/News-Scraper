                        <li>So proper coordination across the sector is necessary.</li>
                        <li>Companies and institutions will rarely expend the resources necessary for the collective
                            security needed to protect the sector, until the right economic incentives are found.

                    <p><strong>No cybersecurity architecture can be foolproof .Why?</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In case of a complex system, attackers will always have the edge over defenders. The number
                            of potential bugs and vulnerable points in any system mean that the mathematical odds favour
                            the attackers.
                        </li>
                        <li>No code can be perfect enough to compensate for human error.</li>
                        <li>Example:A bank might have robust cybersecurity architecture, but it will still be vulnerable
                            if the systems of other networks that carry pertinent information are not secure.
                        </li>
                        <li>In software industry, the more people use a particular software, the more valuable it
                            becomes- has led to a “release first, patch later” approach
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Guideline on Burden of proof. What it is?</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In case of ATM frauds, in US, burden of proof lay with the banks, fared much better than
                            Britain, Norway and the Netherlands, where burden of proof lay with the customer.
                        </li>
                        <li>The RBI’s guidelines on customer liability are welcome in this context.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Way forward</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Data breach disclosure norms, with penalties for failing to do so, are important;</li>
                        <li>Incentivise financial institutions to swiftly report cyberattacks instead of keeping mum to
                            avoid reputation loss, regulatory intervention and liability. Many countries have such
                            norms, but India does not.
                        </li>
                        <li>Address the issues such as regulatory burden and the negative effects of heavy-handed
                            liability laws.

                    <p><strong>Context: </strong>Researchers in Sweden have identified the top four things people can do
                        to reduce their carbon footprint, but warned these steps are rarely promoted in the public
                        sphere.</p>
                    <p><strong>Four Actions</strong></p>
                    <p>Four actions that could result in substantial decreases in an individual’s carbon footprint are:
                        eating a plant-based diet, avoiding air travel, living car-free, and having smaller
                        families.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>A plant-based diet</strong> -While eating plant-based diet saves 0.8 tons of CO2
                            equivalent a year.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>No airplanes</strong>-Avoiding airplane travel saves about 1.6 tons of CO2
                            equivalent per trip.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Living car-free</strong> -Saves about 2.4 tons of CO2 equivalent per year.</li>
                        <li><strong>Smaller families</strong>-One less child saves an average of 58.6 tons of
                            CO2-equivalent emission reductions per year, the report said.
                        </li>
                        <li>Commonly promoted government strategies included changing light bulbs and comprehensive
                            recycling but researchers said these steps are respectively eight and four times less
                            effective than a plant-based diet.

                                    forming an ocean gyre.Unlike all other regions called seas, it has no land
                                    boundaries. <strong>It is distinguished from other parts of the Atlantic Ocean by
                                        its characteristic brown Sargassum seaweed and often calm blue water.</strong>

                                <li>The sea is bounded on the west by the Gulf Stream, on the north by the North
                                    Atlantic Current, on the east by the Canary Current, and on the south by the North
                                    Atlantic Equatorial Current, a clockwise-circulating system of ocean currents termed
                                    the North Atlantic Gyre.
                                </li>
                                <li>It lies between 70º and 40º W, and 20º to 35º N, and is approximately 1,100 km wide
                                    by 3,200 km long (700 by 2,000 statute miles).[5][6] Bermuda is near the western
                                    fringes of the sea.

                            <p>The presence of elevated levels of arsenic in groundwater has become a major concern
                                around the world, especially in South Asia. Up to date, there is no effective treatment
                                for curing health impacts due to the intake of high levels of arsenic. <strong>A wide
                                    range of technologies has been developed for the removal of high concentrations of
                                    arsenic from drinking water. The most common arsenic removal technologies use
                                    oxidation, coagulation, precipitation adsorption, ion exchange and membrane
                                    techniques</strong>. Other potential approaches would include phytoremediation or
                                the use of bacteria, which can play an important role in catalysing biological arsenic
                                removal processes. All the arsenic treatment technologies ultimately concentrate arsenic
                                in the sorption media, the residual sludge or in a liquid media. To avoid indiscriminate
                                disposal and environmental pollution, these wastes need to be treated or disposed of
                                properly.</p></div>

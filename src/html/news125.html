                    feedback to voters using a ballotless voting system. A VVPAT is intended as an independent
                    verification system for voting machines designed to allow voters to verify that their vote was cast
                    correctly, to detect possible election fraud or malfunction, and to provide a means to audit the
                    stored electronic results. It contains name of the candidate (for whom vote has been casted) and
                    symbol of the party/ individual candidate.

                        sold at normal fare. The fare was increased thereafter by 10% for every 10% of the berths sold.
                        The highest fare was 50% more than the normal price of the ticket.

                            to potentially ply bigger aircraft for UDAN flights
                        </li>
                        <li>There will be more flexibility also in how they integrate such routes into their overall

                        <li><strong>UDAN(Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik)</strong> is a regional aviation scheme that encourages
                            airlines to fly to underserved airports at low fares.
                        </li>
                        <li>The airlines have to sell a certain number of seats (between nine and 40 currently) on such
                            flights at a maximum of Rs 2,500 per hour of flying.

                    <p><strong>New changes:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Airlines can now make an UDAN destination part of a connecting flight, making it easier for
                            them to integrate regional aviation routes into their overall operations
                        </li>
                        <li>But airline will have to declare 70% of seats on any such flight as UDAN seats irrespective
                            of the kind of aircraft they are using.
                        </li>
                        <li>They will however only be paid subsidy for a maximum of 40 seats.</li>
                        <li>The ministry has also done away with the stipulation that requires two airports to be 150km
                            away from each other to qualify for UDAN flights.
                        </li>
                        <li>It has also allowed helicopters to participate in UDAN, and, in mountainous regions,
                            four-seater aircraft.

            <p><strong>Consequences of climate change:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Productivity will starts declining strongly</li>
                <li>Countries located in areas with higher temperature will face a disproportionate impact of global
                    warming.
                </li>
                <li>Loss of output and lower productivity also affects capital formation, which has a bearing on medium-
                    to long-term growth prospects.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Present scenario:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Consensus was attained under the <strong>Paris Agreement</strong> to contain the rise in global
                    temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius from the pre industrial levels
                </li>
                <li>But now Trump administration in the US is not keen on continuing with the Paris Agreement.</li>
                <li>It is being reported that advanced economies may not meet their commitment of reducing emissions
                </li>
                <li>The lack of will among industrialized economies to contain emissions, could lead to consequences
                    that go beyond the realm of macroeconomics.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p> <strong>Necessary steps that needs to be taken</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Emerging market and low-income economies have to build significant macroeconomic resilience.</li>
                <li>The IMF notes that right policies and institutions in place may help attenuate the effects of
                    temperature shocks, to some extent.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Way forwards:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Strengthen macroeconomic stability to be able to deal with such shocks.</li>
                <li>Work on programmes that will help improve the quality of land and reduce the risk of climate change.
                    <ul>
                        <li>In Ethiopia, food and cash is provided to the poor who participate in local environmental
                            programmes.
                        </li>
                        <li>This has resulted in reduction in soil loss and has increased the availability of water</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>India can use employment under the MGNREGA in a better way to enhance soil and water conservation.
                </li>
                <li>Strengthen its overall capability by investing in and adopting technology as the impact of climate
                    change is not limited to agriculture
                    <ul>
                        <li>For instance, better use of technology can reduce energy consumption for air conditioning. A
                            district cooling system is being constructed in Gujarat International Finance Tec-City.
                        </li>
                        <li>It can be adopted in other cities as well.</li>

                    <li>Appointment of National Human Rights Commission chiefs.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>In news:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Home Ministry has moved the Cabinet to amend the recruitment process of the National Human
                        Rights Commission (NHRC).
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Key Changes:</strong></li>
                    <li>Retired Supreme Court judge could also be considered for the Chairperson’s position, currently
                        reserved for former Chief Justices of the Supreme Court.
                    </li>
                    <li>Similarly an amendment for appointment of members is also being considered. The members could be
                        picked from a pool of retired Chief Justices of High Courts. Currently, a serving or retired SC
                        judge is considered.
                    </li>
                    <li>The State Human Rights Commissions are also expected to see a change in the appointment
                        procedure. Retired High Court judges could also be considered for the post of State Human Rights
                        Commission chairperson, which is currently held by retired Chief Justices of High Courts.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Key Fact: </strong></li>
                    <li>The NHRC was constituted under the <strong>Protection of Human Rights Act in 1993.</strong> The
                        Act was last amended in 2006.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Commission consists of a chairperson, one member who is or has been a Judge of the Supreme
                        Court, one member who is or has been the Chief Justice of a High Court and two members to be
                        appointed from among persons having knowledge of, or practical experience in, matters relating
                        to human rights.
                    </li>
                    <li>The chairperson and members are appointed by the President on recommendations from a six-member
                        committee chaired by the Prime Minister.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>What next?</strong></li>
                    <li>Once the Cabinet approves them, an amendment to the Protection of Human Rights Act would have to
                        be ratified by Parliament.

                    <li><strong>The Election Commission opinion:</strong></li>
                    <li>All political parties need to be brought on board before such an exercise is carried out.</li>
                    <li>Simultaneous elections will give enough time for incumbent government to formulate policies and
                        implement programmes continuously for a longer time without interruptions caused by imposition
                        of model code of conduct.
                    </li>
                    <li>Conducting the polls together would be possible only when necessary changes in the Constitution
                        and Representation of the People Act are carried out.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Situation at present: </strong></li>
                    <li>Existing legal and constitutional provisions mandates that elections are to be held within six
                        months ahead of the end of the term of a State Assembly or the Lok Sabha.

                    <li><strong>Requirements to hold simultaneous polls:</strong></li>
                    <li>Requirement of 24 lakh each Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit
                        Trail (VVPAT) Machines.
                    </li>
                    <li>Two sets of EVMs — one for Lok Sabha and another for the Assembly polls.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Niti Aayog’s “Three Year Action Agenda, 2017-18 to 2019-20” report:</strong></li>
                    <li>The Niti Aayog has also favoured conducting synchronised two-phase Lok Sabha and Assembly
                        elections from 2024 in “national interest”.
                    </li>
                    <li>All elections in India should happen in a free, fair and synchronised manner to ensure minimum

                <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is expected to visit India “later in October”.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tillerson will become the fourth senior U.S. official to visit New Delhi after the Trump
                        Administration took over.
                    </li>
                    <li>Tillerson is expected to travel to both India and Pakistan on the same visit, indicating a sharp
                        shift from precedent.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Previously:</strong> During the Bush and Obama administrations, U.S. officials had
                        avoided clubbing visits to New Delhi and Islamabad because of India’s sensitivities over a
                        <strong>“hyphenation</strong>” of the U.S.’s relations with India and Pakistan.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>New Afghan policy:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The U.S. Secretary of State’s visit to India is likely to highlight growing ties between New
                        Delhi and Washington, and growing cooperation between them on Afghanistan.

                <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Obstacles in the trade pact between India and the EU.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Change in global dynamics</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Brexit</li>
                    <li>Elections in Germany and France</li>
                    <li>Visible rifts between eastern and western countries on what constitute core EU values</li>
                    <li>Election in the US and consequent retreat of the US from its leadership of the west</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The reference to India and EU as “<strong>world’s largest democracies</strong>”- Such a
                        statement is generally made with reference to sovereign countries. Interestingly, EU per se is
                        not a sovereign country but a group of sovereign countries. Such a mention is more notable this
                        time in light of the U.S.’s uncertain position on the international stage and EU’s need for a
                        stronger union post Brexit.
                    </li>
                    <li>The countries have reiterated their commitment for a <strong>“Rules based”</strong> and <strong>“Multipolar”</strong>
                        world–
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Rules based world:</strong> This term assumes significance on the backdrop of the US
                        going back on its promises on Paris climate agreement and the probability of the same on the
                        Iran Nuclear deal
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Multipolar world:</strong> The reference to multipolarity is a recognition that there is
                        more than just one chair at the top table, not just with the U.S.’s shifting position but also
                        due to Russia and China’s ascent.
                    </li>
                    <li>The India-EU joint statement on terrorism this year called for “decisive and concerted actions”
                        against Hafiz Saeed, Dawood Ibrahim, Lashkar-e-Taiba and other purveyors of terror; this will
                        further bolster India’s efforts to call out Pakistan on the issue of sponsoring terror.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Roadblocks in talks on BTIA:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Recent summits have been conspicuous by the absence of talks on the BTIA (Broad-based Trade and
                        Investment Agreement). There is disagreement on whether the protection of foreign investments
                        will be part of the BTIA or dealt with in a stand-alone treaty
                    </li>
                    <li>Indian demand for liberalising the access to natural persons- India wanting a greater ease of
                        movement of temporary skilled workers to provide services in the EU and the EU wanting greater
                        market access for its automobiles and its wines and spirits. Wanting an open market for
                        automobiles and liquor but unduly restricting the movement of natural persons (with barriers in
                        terms of salary thresholds, recognition of qualifications, visa fees, social security and so
                        forth) seems to be a case of double standards.
                    </li>
                    <li>EU not granting “data secure” certification to India – a condition that facilitates the
                        cross-border transfer of personal data. India does not have a stand-alone law on data privacy
                        and this could be acting as a barrier too as EU is very seriously taking steps to secure digital
                        data privacy of its citizens.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Way forward:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Convergence of values and interests:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>EU is India’s largest trade partner (over 100 billion Euros in bilateral trade of goods and
                        services last year). EU, like India, is also wary of China’s political and economic dominance.
                    </li>
                    <li>Uncertainty over EU’s future in the next decade: With Brexit and other important developments,
                        there is no clarity about what presence will EU have in the next decade. Hence, cementing trade
                        ties with India will help strengthen EU’s economic future.
                    </li>
                    <li>“Data secure” certification: India needs to enact a strong Data Privacy Law which protects the
                        digital data privacy of its citizens. This is necessary to protect the economic interests of the
                        Indian IT industry.
                    </li>
                    <li>India is right to strike a hard bargain as far as the temporary movement of skilled workers is
                        concerned. The EU and other developed countries have been historically reluctant about moving
                        forward on this and the issue has become more challenging with the rise of populism and
                        protectionism in Europe.

                    <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gujarat agricultural model from 2003 to 2014</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Agriculture Growth of Gujarat from 2003 to 2014</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gujarat’s agri-GDP registered an unprecedented growth of 8 per cent per annum during 2002-03
                            to 2013-14, way more than the all-India figure of 3.3 per cent per annum
                        </li>
                        <li>Gujarat’s agri-growth was even higher than that achieved by Punjab during the Green
                            Revolution’s
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Expectations from the Gujarat model</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When Modi became the prime minister in May 2014, one was expecting that the “Gujarat model”
                            would be extended to many states, with the fine-tuning to suit each state’s requirements
                        </li>
                        <li>But the growth of all-India agri-GDP in the first three years of NDA rule has come down to
                            1.8 per cent
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Is deficient rain the reason behind this situation?</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Deficient rain in 2014-15 and 2015-16 is of course one factor behind this poor performance
                        </li>
                        <li>But there were bumper harvests in 2016-17, yet farmers suffered due to a collapse in
                            agri-prices
                        </li>
                        <li>The advance estimates of 2017-18 do not indicate much recovery</li>
                        <li>Reasons behind Gujarat’s excellent agri-performance during 2003 to 2014</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>First</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Atal Bihari Vajpayee government’s bold decision to allow the commercial use of Bt cotton
                            became a catalyst for change, from which Gujarat benefited the most
                        </li>
                        <li>From nowhere in 2002, Bt cotton spread to more than 90 per cent of the area under cotton in
                            Gujarat by 2014
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Second</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>China is taking over Syngenta for $43 billion to access the best technologies for its
                            farmers
                        </li>
                        <li>While the Centre is creating conditions that may force companies like Monsanto to quit</li>
                        <li>This government is literally reversing the benefits that the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government
                            bestowed to farmers
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Third</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gujarat government at that time provided basic infrastructure to farmers — irrigation, power
                            and roads enabled the easy adoption of Bt cotton, and benefited other crops and the
                            livestock sector as well
                        </li>
                        <li>Currently, Gujarat has one of the best road-network in the country, of which 89 per cent are
                            pucca/surfaced roads
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Fourth</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Good marketing institutions propelled Gujarat agriculture, especially its dairy industry
                        </li>
                        <li>The AMUL model of directly buying milk from farmers’ cooperatives and processing and
                            distributing it through millions of outlets ensures that farmers receive 75-80 per cent of
                            the consumers’ price
                        </li>
                        <li>This model is worth extending to other commodities, especially fruits and vegetables,
                            bypassing the mandi system
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>The way forward</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Enable farmers to access best technologies and best markets at home or abroad</li>
                        <li>Invest in basic infrastructure that can give access to water for irrigation, power and rural
                            roads
                        </li>
                        <li>Create AMUL type institutions for other commodities to enable farmers to access high share
                            of consumers’ price
                        </li>
                        <li>Export bans or high minimum export prices for agri-products are anti-farmer</li>

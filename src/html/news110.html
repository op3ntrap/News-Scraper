                    <ul>
                        <li>The Indus Waters Treaty is a water-distribution treaty between India and Pakistan, brokered
                            by the World Bank (then the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development).
                        </li>
                        <li>The treaty was signed in Karachi on September 19, 1960 by Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal
                            Nehru and President of Pakistan Ayub Khan.
                        </li>
                        <li>According to this agreement, control over the three “eastern” rivers — the Beas, the Ravi
                            and the Sutlej — was given to India, while control over the three “western” rivers — the
                            Indus, the Chenab and the Jhelum — to Pakistan.
                        </li>
                        <li>More controversial, however, were the provisions on how the waters were to be shared. Since
                            Pakistan’s rivers flow through India first, the treaty allowed India to use them for
                            irrigation, transport and power generation, while laying down precise regulations for Indian
                            building projects along the way.
                        </li>
                        <li>The treaty was a result of Pakistani fear that, since the source rivers of the Indus basin
                            were in India, it could potentially create droughts and famines in Pakistan, especially at
                            times of war.

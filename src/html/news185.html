            <ul>
                <li>Home Minister Rajnath Singh will chair a meeting of the <strong>Standing Committee of the Inter
                    State Council (ISC)</strong> to discuss the recommendations made by the <strong>Puncchi Commission
                    on Centre-State relations.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p> </p>
            <p><strong>About Puncchi Commission</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Punchhi Commission, which was notified in 2005, submitted its report in 2010.</li>
                <li>Its recommendations pertaining to national security, communal harmony, Centre-State financial
                    relations and planning are expected to be discussed.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Commission observations:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Commission in its report had said that ‘<strong>National Security’</strong> as a subject was not
                    specifically listed in any of the three Lists, i.e. the Union, the State or the Concurrent List.
                </li>
                <li>The subject of Security under the <strong>Article 352</strong> and under the Emergency Provisions in
                    Part XVIII of the Constitution has been assigned to the Union Government. Though it is an overriding
                    executive power of the Union, in Constitutional practice, however, ‘Security’ is a subject in which
                    the States and the Union have a common interest and are expected to act in a co-ordinated manner.
                </li>
                <li>The Commission also said that in case of communal riots, which has a potential of causing widespread
                    violence within a territory, “the use of <strong>Article 355</strong> may be in order.” “A
                    clarificatory line in this, regard, if required, may be inserted making the provision explicitly
                    clear that the Centre can depute Paramilitary Forces to such trouble spots in exceptional
                    circumstances even if a request from the State Government is not received. The aim has to be to
                    ensure quick control of the situation, bring it back to normal, hand over the area to the local
                    administration as quickly as possible and then withdraw the Central forces.
                </li>

                People passes a resolution disapproving, or, as the case may be, disapproving the continuance in force
                of, such Proclamation</p>

                House of the People has been given of, their intention to move a resolution for disapproving, or, as the

                <li><strong>Chief Justice of India</strong> rejected a public interest litigation petition suggesting
                    fresh elections whenever the public chose overwhelmingly the “None of the Above” (NOTA) option.

                <li>Holding elections in our country costs money.</li>

            <p><strong>Supreme Court advocate Ashiwni Upadhyay opinion</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If NOTA got the highest number of votes, it would amount to an expression of public dissatisfaction
                    with the candidates in the fray.
                </li>
                <li>If this happened, the result should have to be nullified by the Election Commission.</li>
                <li>His petition had even sought a ban on the parties and their candidates who failed to NOTA in the
                    first election from contesting the fresh polls.

            </ul>
            <p><strong>Basic Information:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>NOTA option</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>“None Of The Above”, or NOTA for short, also known as “against all” or a “scratch” vote, is a ballot
                    option in some jurisdictions or organizations, designed to allow the voter to indicate disapproval
                    of all of the candidates in a voting system
                </li>
                <li>It is based on the principle that consent requires the ability to withhold consent in an election,
                    just as they can by voting “No” on ballot questions
                </li>
                <li>When “None of the Above” is listed on a ballot, there is the possibility of NOTA receiving a
                    majority or plurality of the vote, and so “winning” the election
                </li>
                <li>In such a case, a variety of formal procedures may be invoked, including having the office remain
                    vacant, having the office filled by appointment, re-opening nominations or holding another election
                    (in a body operating under parliamentary procedure), or it may have no effect whatsoever, as in

                </li>
                <li>A BBB- rating denotes the lowest investment grade rating for India’s sovereign debt.</li>
                <li>S&amp;P expects India’s economy to grow robustly over the two-year period from 2018-20 with foreign
                    exchange reserves rising further.
                </li>
                <li>India’s GDP growth rate is among the fastest of all investment-grade sovereigns, and we expect real

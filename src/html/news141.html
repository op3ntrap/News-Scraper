            <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The petition filed by advocate took exception to a particular chapter in a book titled ‘Post-Hindu
                    India’ called ‘Hindutv-Mukt Bharat’.
                </li>
                <li>The book is critical about the caste system prevailing in India, especially in the Arya Vysya
                    community.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Supreme Court Observation: </strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>“Any request for banning a book of the present nature has to be strictly scrutinized because every
                    author or writer has a fundamental right to speak out ideas freely and express thoughts adequately.
                    Curtailment of an individual writer/author’s right to freedom of speech and expression should never
                    be lightly viewed,”
                </li>
                <li>It is not up to the Supreme Court to use its powers to ban books, which are a free expression of a
                    writer’s thoughts and feelings about the society and world he lives in. Courts cannot be asked to
                    gag free expression.
                </li>
                <li>The Supreme Court has always placed the fundamental right to free speech at the highest pedestal.
                </li>
                <li>This is what the Supreme Court recorded in its two-page order while dismissing a petition to ban a
                    book written by writer and activist Professor Kancha Ilaiah Shepherd called Samajika Smugglurlu
                    Komatollu.

                <li>Addressing women BJP workers in a town hall interaction, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj
                    said that soon <strong>non-resident Indians</strong> (NRIs) would be able to
                    <strong>proxy-vote</strong> in elections in the country as the government was set to amend the
                    <strong>Representation of the People Act</strong>.

            </ul>
            <p><strong>Present situation:  </strong>under the present law, NRIs registered in India as voters had to fly
                to the country during an election to cast their vote, but with the amendment, they could just issue an
                authorization letter to family members or relatives to vote on their behalf.</p>

                <li>After sending a rebuttal to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) challenging India’s ranking
                    in a global slavery report, India will build pressure on the global body to distance itself from the
                    Australia-based <strong>NGO-Walk Free Foundation.</strong></li>
                <li>It was the WFF, founded by Australia’s mining mogul Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest, that had compiled the
                    report.
                </li>
                <li>As per the report, the highest number of people, 17,000, were surveyed in India and it was placed in
                    a cluster of 53 countries like Honduras, Belize, Iraq, Pakistan and China.
                </li>
                <li>Indian security agencies informed the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) that though the methodology of
                    sampling was not clear, the WFF’s entire focus was on India and had “<strong>enough potential to
                        substantively harm India’s image and kill its exports market”.</strong></li>
                <li>The PMO was warned that there was “<strong>evidence of rising interest of private and multilateral
                    institutions in highlighting human trafficking and forced labour as modern-day slavery, with India
                    being the largest hub of slaves”.</strong><strong> </strong></li>

            <p><strong>Point-wise rejoinder</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Centre has tasked the <strong>V. Giri National Labour Institute</strong>, an autonomous body
                    under the Labour and Employment Ministry, to prepare a point-wise rejoinder to the ‘<strong>modern
                        slavery’ report</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>The Labour Ministry shot off a strong letter to the ILO regarding its report titled ‘<strong>Global
                    Estimates of Modern Slavery: Forced Labour and Forced Marriage 2017,’</strong> The report released
                    on September 19 did not contain any India-specific findings, barring one mention that 17,000 people
                    were interviewed for the survey.

            <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bottom trawling by Indian fishermen had emerged as a major issue because of the disruptive impact it
                    left on the coastal communities of Sri Lanka.
                </li>
                <li>Earlier in July, Sri Lanka banned bottom trawling, increasing the chances of interception of more
                    Indian bottom trawlers.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>In news:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>India informed Sri Lanka that it has taken measures to stop bottom trawling by its fishermen in the
                    waters near the Sri Lankan coastline.
                </li>
                <li>During a weekend meeting of the <strong>Joint Working Group (JWG)</strong> in Delhi, officials
                    expressed satisfaction over the release of Indian fishermen by Colombo, and reiterated the need to
                    bring the rest of them back to India.
                </li>

            <ul>
                <li>Recent initiatives taken by the Government of India to end bottom trawling in the <strong>Palk Bay
                    area</strong> include the launch of a programme on diversification of bottom trawlers into deep-sea
                    fishing vessels for tuna long lining under the <strong>Blue Revolution Scheme</strong>, construction
                    of <strong>Mookaiyu</strong>r and <strong>Poompuhar fishing harbours</strong>, and capacity-building
                    programmes for fishermen of the Palk Bay area in deep sea tuna long lining.
                </li>
                <li>Besides, fresh registration for bottom trawlers in the Palk Bay area has been banned by the
                    Government of Tamil Nadu.
                </li>
                <li>India has informed that schemes promoting <strong>seaweed farming</strong> and <strong>sea-cage
                    farming</strong> have begun in the <strong>Palk Bay area</strong> to wean away fishermen from
                    <strong>deep-sea trawling.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Joint Working Group (JWG) mandate:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>From the beginning, the JWG has been dealing with the twin problems of arrest of Indian fishermen
                    and boats by Sri Lanka and Sri Lanka’s complaint against Indian fishermen for using “bottom
                    trawling” which erodes aquatic resources in the Palk Bay area.

                <li>India’s second strategic nuclear submarine <strong>Aridhaman</strong> is just a few weeks from sea
                    launch.
                </li>
                <li>There are plans to build a bigger and more potent version of the indigenous nuclear submarine in the

            <p><strong>New features to be added: </strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The leap for India’s ballistic nuclear submarine capabilities would come with the fourth submarine
                    planned in the same class, named S4-Star.
                </li>
                <li>It would have a stronger weapons configuration integrated into an extra compartment that would be
                    added to Arihant’s original design.

            <ul>
                <li>The indigenously built second nuclear submarine will add to India’s growing nuclear capabilities, in
                    the face of the new strategic realities of the region, including the assertive Chinese naval
                    presence in the Indian Ocean.

            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key Facts:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Last October, India commissioned its first Ballistic Nuclear Submarine, <strong>INS Arihant</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>The vessel, weighing 6,000 tonnes, is powered by an 83 MW pressurised light water nuclear reactor.
                </li>
                <li>The project to build a strategic nuclear submarine to carry nuclear missiles began as the Advanced
                    Technology Vessel project in the 1980s, and the vessel project was launched in 2009 by Dr. Manmohan
                    Singh.
                </li>
                <li>Arihant, which can carry nuclear tipped ballistic missiles, is of the ship submersible ballistic
                    nuclear class.

                <p>Topic: Current Affairs<br/> Level: Moderate</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
                <p><strong>The Guidelines on Fair Trade Practices Related to Charging of Service Charge from Consumers
                    by Hotels and Restaurants-</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The government approved new guidelines which gives consumers the right to decide service charge
                        they wish to voluntarily pay on a hotel or restaurant bill.
                    </li>
                    <li>While the new norms provide relief to those dining out, the hotel industry is not likely to take
                        it lying down as they feel being singled out.
                    </li>
                    <li>The new guidelines has been issued in public interest to protect consumers right</li>
                    <li>Mandatory levy of service charge amounts to unfair trade practice.</li>
                    <li>Hotels and restaurants should not decide how much service charge is to be paid by the customer
                        and it should be left to the discretion of the customer.
                    </li>
                    <li>The (food) bill presented to the customer may clearly display that the service charge is
                        voluntary and the service charge column of the bill may be left blank for the customer to fill
                        before making payment.
                    </li>
                    <li>The guidelines made it clear that a component of service is inherent in provision of food and
                        beverages ordered by a customer and pricing of the product is expected to cover both goods and
                        service components.
                    </li>
                    <li>Placing of an order by a customer amounts to his or her agreement to pay the prices displayed on
                        the menu card along with the applicable taxes. Charges for anything other than the
                        aforementioned without express consent of the customer would amount to unfair trade practices as
                        defined under the Act
                    </li>
                    <li>Tip or gratuity paid by customers is towards hospitality received by them beyond the basic
                        minimum service already contracted between them and the hotel management.It is a separate
                        transaction between the customer and the staff of the hotel or restaurant, which is entered into
                        at the customers discretion.
                    </li>
                    <li>Customers can assess quality of service and decide whether or not to pay tip only after having
                        the meal, the order said it is “not correct” if a hotel or restaurant considers that entry of a
                        customer to its premises amounts to his or her implied consent to pay service charge.
                    </li>
                    <li>Any restriction on the entry into a hotel based on this amounts to restrictive trade practice as
                        defined under the Act.
                    </li>

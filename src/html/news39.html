                <li>The boat carrying the idol had a halt at Mappilasseri, a traditional Christian home at Champakulam.
                    It was given a reception by people of all communities and the voyage to Ambalappuzha was marked by
                    festivities.

                    recommended several steps to ensure the “light regulation” of non-governmental organisations (NGOs)
                    so as to reduce their harassment.

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Registration procedures</strong> be modernised so as to facilitate the seamless operation of
                    the applicable provisions of the IT (Income Tax) Act and FCRA (Foreign Contribution Regulation Act)
                    with respect to NGOs, without the need for cumbersome and intrusive processes.
                </li>
                <li>Steps must be taken to “reduce the need for a physical interface between NGOs and public officials
                    acting under the IT Act and the FCRA, along with reduction in mutual distrust and scope for misuse.
                </li>
                <li>The committee has drawn up a framework of guidelines for the accreditation of NGOs, audit of their
                    accounts, and procedures to initiate action for recovering grants in case of misappropriation.
                </li>
                <li>A nodal body to oversee the various interfaces between NGOs and the government, and has recommended
                    that NITI Aayog be vested with the power
                </li>
                <li>It has recommended an overarching legislation with best practices that would replace various
                    State-level and existing Central laws.
                </li>

                <li>The Union Government of India has begun its first ever in-depth assessment of Chinese investments in
                    India’s neighbouring countries.

            <ul>
                <li>Trends show that there have been an increasing influence of China in the Indian sub-continent and
                    South Asia
                </li>
                <li>Pakistan government data shows that FDI from China jumped from $256.8 million in 2014-15 to $878.8
                    million in 2016-17 (July-May).<strong> </strong></li>

            <ul>
                <li>The study will analyse the impact of these Chinese investments — including those being made as part
                    of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI, also known as One Belt One Road or OBOR) — on India’s national
                    security.
                </li>
                <li>In addition to assessing the nature and impact of Chinese FDI in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, Nepal,
                    Pakistan and Sri Lanka, the study will track Chinese investments in Afghanistan and Maldives too.
                </li>
                <li>The major challenge in the study will be the lack of detailed, country-wise data on overall FDI
                    (year-wise) and Chinese FDI, in particular.
                </li>

            <ul>
                <li>Chinese investments in countries like Pakistan could, in turn, set the stage for Pakistan to make
                    inroads into markets in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal and challenge the presence of Indian firms
                    in these markets, where India is currently the major player.
                </li>
                <li>The CPEC(China – Pakistan Economic Corridor)/OBOR projects can also better link Pakistan with the

            <p><strong>Cloud seeding:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cloud seeding is a form of weather modification, a way of changing the amount or type of
                    precipitation that falls from clouds, by dispersing substances into the air that serve as cloud
                    condensation or ice nuclei, which alter the microphysical processes within the cloud.
                </li>
                <li>The usual intent is to increase precipitation (rain or snow), but hail and fog suppression are also
                    widely practiced in airports.
                </li>
                <li>The most common chemicals used for cloud seeding include silver iodide, potassium iodide and dry ice
                    (solid carbon dioxide). Liquid propane, which expands into a gas, has also been used.
                </li>
                <li>This can produce ice crystals at higher temperatures than silver iodide. After promising research,
                    the use of hygroscopic materials, such as table salt, is becoming more popular.

            <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
            <p> How AI can provide solutions to human and social development challenges?</p>
            <p><strong>Health and nutrition </strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>High level of malnutrition and stunted growth in pre-school children in India is alarming</li>
                <li>AI-based systems can be used to improve delivery of child nutrition programmes</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How AI can help?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>AI-based systems collect and examine data about children and track the progress of an individual
                    child in terms of their cognitive development and health.
                </li>
                <li>Image-recognition techniques can help in early identification of stunted growth, epidemics and other
                    health issues.
                </li>
                <li>It assist in diagnosis of problems being faced—from drought to poor sanitation and inadequate
                    supplies
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Agriculture</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>US have used AI to develop “precision farming” practices, which lead to a more efficient use of
                    inputs and higher yields.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How it works?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sensors gather information about the condition and colour of foliage and soil moisture content.</li>
                <li>This information is fed to the system, which determines the amount of water, and fertilizer to be
                    provided.
                </li>
                <li>It also specifies which part of the plant needs to be provided with these inputs.</li>
                <li>These systems have reported higher yields and reduction in agricultural inputs.</li>
                <li>Education</li>
                <li>Learning outcomes of young minds are notoriously poor in our current education system.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>AI-based systems can assist students with their learning experience.How?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Changing the form and nature of content to suit the student.</li>
                <li>“Smart content” is generated with text summaries, supported with related videos and simulations.
                </li>
                <li>Intelligent tutor systems are an example of the same (see Carnegielearning.com).</li>
                <li>MIT’s Media Labs has also developed “personal robots” which work and interact with humans as
                    peers.
                </li>
                <li>Some of them are even capable of identifying and correcting misconceptions of a student as they
                    learn the material.
                </li>
                <li>Provides timely feedback to students and teachers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Concerns about AI?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Expensive today.</li>
                <li>Ethical issues of privacy of data, equity and liability of actions.</li>

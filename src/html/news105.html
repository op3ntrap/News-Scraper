                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Electoral Reforms.</strong></li>
                    <li>The Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice, headed by Congress
                        leader Anand Sharma is deliberating on electoral reforms
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>In News: </strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Reforms suggested by: </strong>The Congress, the Nationalist Congress Party, the
                        Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Communist Party of India.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>What? </strong>The above said parties have told a <strong>Parliamentary panel</strong>
                        that the existing <strong>first-past-the-post-system</strong> needs to be replaced with a
                        <strong>hybrid format</strong> where elections for a small number of seats are through <strong>proportional
                            representation.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Hybrid format: </strong>to include both first-past-the-post-system and proportional
                        representation system <strong>.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Argument in favour for proportional representation system</strong>:</li>
                </ul>
                <ol>
                    <li>Majority aspirations and the actual will of the people is not getting reflected in election
                        results. Example : Recent Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections held in March this year where the BJP
                        which got 39 per cent of the vote share but won 312 seats, while the Samajwadi Party with 21.8
                        per cent votes got 47 seats and the Bahujan Samaj Party with 22.2 per cent got 19 seats.
                    </li>
                    <li>A party with even 20% share does not get a single seat, while a party with 28% can get
                        disproportionately large number of seats.
                    </li>

                            <li><strong>First-past-the-post system:</strong> A first-past-the-post (abbreviated as FPTP,
                                1stP, 1PTP or FPP) voting method is one in which voters indicate on a ballot the
                                candidate of their choice, and the candidate who receives most votes wins.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong> Proportional representation system:</strong> Proportional representation is the
                                idea that seats in parliament should be allocated so that they are in proportion to the
                                votes cast.

                                claimed to exist in several countries. The game allegedly consists of a series of tasks

                                requiring the player to commit suicide.

                <p><strong>Evaluation of Performance:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Union Government has initiated a process to “evaluate” the performance of Judges recommended
                        by the High Court collegium for appointment as judges of the court
                    </li>

                    <li>In the case of advocates, their reported judgements and in case of judicial officers, their case
                        disposal time and number of adjournments are being evaluated
                    </li>
                    <li>These evaluations will be done by an in house team having legal background</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Reason behind this step</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is an internal effort by the government towards greater appraisal and scrutiny for better
                        candidates
                    </li>
                    <li>This decision is in light of the SC’s own observations in the NJAC(National Judicial Appointment
                        commission )matter and Justice C S Karnan case
                    </li>
                    <li>The current mechanism for appointment of judges of the higher judiciary follows the collegium
                        system
                    </li>
                    <li>There are many instances of alleged corruption and irregularities which have brought the system
                        under the scanner
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>What now?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The final decision on the appointments(of HC judges) is taken by the SC collegium (as done
                        before).
                    </li>
                    <li>And the inputs provided by the government, including the result of the evaluation, will assist
                        in the process.

                    <li>Provisions to restrict cross-shareholding between rating agencies without regulatory approval to
                        10%
                    </li>
                    <li>Increase the minimum net worth requirement for existing and new agencies from ₹5 crore to ₹50
                        crore
                    </li>
                    <li>There should be at least five years’ experience for promoters of rating agencies</li>
                    <li>SEBI has proposed disclosure norms to improve investor awareness about the operations of rating
                        agencies
                    </li>
                    <li>It is to prevent rating agencies from resorting to collusion in reaching decisions.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Criticism</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The present business model of rating agencies allow considerable room for issuers of securities
                        to shop for a favourable rating or avoid negative ratings by severing their ties with these
                        agencies.
                    </li>
                    <li>Prudential regulation is thus justified to tackle this problem. This criticism, however, ignores
                        the reputational damage these agencies suffer after each corporate default
                    </li>
                    <li>But repeated failures have not affected the business of rating agencies, primarily due to the
                        lack of alternative service providers who can help out investors.
                    </li>
                    <li>Individual creditors have thus had to trust the ratings of the existing rating agencies at their
                        own peril, even after repeated crises
                    </li>
                    <li>Indian credit rating market is an oligopolistic one due to the high barriers to entry.</li>
                    <li>SEBI’s proposed move to impose further quality requirements on rating agencies is unlikely to
                        change things for the better, or raise further barriers.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Way forward</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make it easier for new players to enter the credit rating space and compete against
                        incumbents.
                    </li>
                    <li>This will make credit rating agencies actually serve creditors rather than borrowers.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>IIT Roorkee</strong> is planning to deploy <strong>early earthquake warning
                        system</strong>, the first-of-its-kind system across all sesmic-prone major cities of the north
                        India.
                    </li>
                    <li>Predicting earthquakes is impossible, but it is possible to save people living in distant cities
                        through a simple warning system, which will give them enough lead time to reach a safe open
                        place in case of an impending earthquake.
                    </li>
                    <li>The early earthquake warning system works on the <strong>principle of propagation of various
                        waves </strong>with different velocities starting together from the same point and reaching the
                        target at different times.
                    </li>
                    <li>The <strong>Electromagnetic (EM) waves</strong> travel much faster and will reach the target
                        much ahead of the damaging seismic waves giving what we call a lead time
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>About the project:</strong></li>
                    <li>This project in India is part of the overall research being conducted by the IIT Roorkee, in the
                        field of earthquake engineering and is an extension of the pilot project undertaken in the
                        Himalayan region.
                    </li>
                    <li>IIT Roorkee was the first institute to deploy 84 sensors in seismic gap region of the <strong>Garhwal
                        Himalayas in Uttarakhand</strong> with the help of the Ministry of Earth Sciences.
                    </li>
                    <li>These on-site sensors stream data in real-time to a computer server at the institute using
                        network of the Uttarakhand government which is being processed for issuing warning for magnitude
                        6 and above earthquakes.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Central seismic gap:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Recent data sets compiled over the last 2 centuries reveal that large magnitude earthquakes have
                        occurred around various regions of the Himalayas, but one segment of the central Himalaya, known
                        as the <strong>central seismic gap</strong>, has potential to generate a major earthquake and
                        researchers tend to believe that such an earthquake is overdue.
                    </li>
                    <li>The seismic sources with such potential in proximity to cities like Delhi has made this region a
                        perfect case for the use of early earthquake warning system as one of the key disaster
                        mitigation strategies.

                            bamboo huts and thatched roofs. Since then Project Dantak has not looked back. It has
                            contributed to economic growth of Bhutan by not only developing roads and tele-communication
                            net works but also other prestigious works throughout Bhutan. Over the years, Project Dantak
                            has constructed 1500 Km of roads, airfields, a number of helipads, tele-communication
                            network in Bhutan, Indo-Bhutan Microwave link, Bhutan Broadcasting Station, the prestigious

                                <li>The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors in the U.S.
                                    have detected yet another merger of two black holes.
                                </li>
                                <li>This signal marks the third confirmed <strong>detection of gravitational waves
                                    coming from a binary black hole merger</strong>.
                                </li>
                                <li>It is of great interest to the scientific community that the black holes, having
                                    masses nearly 31 times and 19 times the sun’s. Until the first detection of
                                    gravitational waves by LIGO in 2015 (GW150914) it was not known that such massive
                                    black holes could exist.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>New findings: How black holes might have been formed?</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The detection has revealed not merely a black hole merger, but also the alignment of
                                    the spins of the black holes.
                                </li>
                                <li>The spins of the individual black holes making up the merger are probably not
                                    aligned along the same direction. This supports the theory which says that black
                                    holes form independently in a star cluster, then sink to the centre of the cluster
                                    and eventually merge
                                </li>
                                <li>The new observations yields support to Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity.
                                    According to this theory, gravitational waves, unlike light waves, will not disperse
                                    as they travel through space. This too has been confirmed by the analysis of the
                                    presently detected signal.

                                <li>One drawback of having just the two detectors at Hanford, Washington and Livingston,
                                    Louisiana tuned to detect gravitational waves is that they cannot accurately figure
                                    out where in the sky the signal is coming from.
                                </li>

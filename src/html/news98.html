            <p><strong>In news:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Union government has dropped plans to <strong>recognise transgender</strong> persons as the
                    <strong>‘third gender’</strong> in the country’s labour law framework.
                </li>
                <li>The Wages Code Bill was drafted under an exercise to rationalise the country’s 44 labour laws into
                    four codes covering all the regulations pertaining to wages, industrial relations, social security
                    and safety, and health and working conditions.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>In 2014, the Supreme Court had for the first time recognised transgender persons as the ‘<strong>third
                    gender’</strong> and asked the Centre and the States to give them <strong>equal opportunities in
                    education and employment</strong>.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Objections raised:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Labour Ministry’s proposal:</strong> proposed inserting clauses for recognising the rights
                    of transgender workers in all the four labour codes.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Law Ministry’s objection:</strong> the Law Ministry objected, citing the <strong>General
                    Clauses Act of 1897</strong>, according to which ‘transgenders’ fall within the definition of
                    ‘person’. It was then decided that there was no need to add a separate clause for them.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Transgender rights activist opinion:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dropping the separate clauses protecting transgender persons is a hypocritical move by the Union
                    government, as it is well known that we face discrimination at the workplace.
                </li>
                <li>The dignity of our body needs to be protected at the workplace as well, with basic facilities such
                    as restrooms and equal wages,”
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong> </strong><strong>Factories Act and Government proposal: </strong></p>
            <p><strong>Proposal: </strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The government’s proposed amendments to the Factories Act, 1948 in 2015 had also proposed special
                    protections for transgender workers.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Proposal:</strong> “Every transgender worker shall have equal right to work opportunities in
                    a factory. The state government may make rules providing to secure the rights of transgender workers
                    to ensure respect for inherent dignity, non-discrimination, full and effective participation and
                    inclusion in society, respect for difference and acceptance of transgender persons as part of human
                    diversity and humanity,”.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Dropped:</strong> in the case of the Factories Act, too, the clause pertaining to transgenders
                has been dropped in the latest draft amendments.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Satatistics:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fifth Annual Employment-Unemployment Survey</strong> conducted by the <strong>Labour Bureau
                    in 2015-16:</strong> 48% of transgender were either working or were available for work, as against
                    23.7% females, and 75% males.

            <p><strong>Issues with Bank Merger:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Various governments has highlighted the need for large-sized banks to fund the huge infrastructure
                    requirements of the country as well as compete with global lenders
                </li>
                <li><strong>But a serious question arises:</strong> ‘Which chief executive will propose to merge his
                    bank with another and lose his job?’
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Move by the current government</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Present government has no intention to make it ‘voluntary’ for the board of a bank to decide on a
                    merger
                </li>
                <li>It is evident from the fact that government has wrote letters to banks to kick start the process of
                    mergers and get their respective boards’ approval
                </li>
                <li>This may be the first time in recent history that an official communication has been made by the
                    government to the banks asking them to act on mergers
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Alternative Mechanism</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The government has also set up an ‘Alternative Mechanism’</li>
                <li>It would comprise a ministerial group, to oversee proposals for mergers among banks</li>
                <li>A framework had been conceived in which a bank’s board would first clear the decision to merge</li>
                <li>And then send the proposal to the ‘Alternative Mechanism’ for its in-principle approval</li>
                <li>After the in-principle approval comes through, the bank will take steps in accordance with law and
                    SEBI’s requirements
                </li>
                <li>The final scheme will be notified by the government in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India
                    (RBI)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>No need of CCI permission, now</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Some hurdles have been removed to expedite the process</li>
                <li>For example, approval requirement from the Competition Commission of India(CCI) has been done away
                    with
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Post Merger Issues</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The merger would create a lot of complexities in terms of branch rationalisation and reduction in
                    human resources productivity for the merged entity
                </li>
                <li>At present, we’ve an example of the merger of SBI with associate banks</li>
                <li>Bhartiya Mahila Bank; post merger, the merged entity fundamentals have weakened significantly</li>
                <li>Also, after its merger, SBI has seen NPAs rising significantly, from Rs. 1.01 lakh crore (6.94%) to
                    Rs. 1.88 lakh crore (9.97%)

            <p><strong> </strong><strong>Natural Capital:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Natural capital can be defined as the world’s stocks of natural assets which include geology, soil,
                    air, water and all living things
                </li>
                <li>It is from this natural capital that humans derive a wide range of services, often called ecosystem
                    services, which make human life possible
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Value of the Indian Natural Capital:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>With 11% of the world’s floral and faunal species, India is one of the 17 most ecologically diverse
                    countries
                </li>
                <li>India is blessed with every major ecosystem, these biomes directly contribute billions of dollars to
                    the Indian economy, annually
                </li>
                <li>The financial value of India’s forests, for example, which encompass economic services such as
                    timber and fuel wood, and ecological services such as carbon sequestration, is estimated to be $1.7
                    trillion

            </ul>
            <p><strong>Boundaries:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Scientists have identified nine earth system processes to have boundaries</li>
                <li>These boundaries mark the safe zones, beyond which there is a risk of ‘irreversible and abrupt
                    environmental change’
                </li>
                <li>Four of these boundaries have now been crossed</li>
            </ul>
            <p>(1) climate change</p>
            <p>(2) loss of biosphere integrity</p>
            <p>(3) land system change</p>
            <p>(4) biogeochemical cycles, such as phosphorus and nitrogen cycles</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This means that human activity has already altered the balance of a few delicate equilibriums</li>
                <li>The effects of these alterations are reflected by changing weather patterns, accelerated extinction
                    events for both flora and fauna, and global warming
                </li>
                <li>This stresses the need for a comprehensive evaluation system that takes these undesirable
                    side-effects of economic activities into account
                </li>

            <p><strong>Way forward</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Unlike the economic value of goods and services, the intangible nature of natural assets is mostly
                    invisible and hence remains unaccounted for
                </li>

                <li>The National Green tribunal had earlier rapped the four northern States- <strong>Haryana, Uttar
                    Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan</strong>, for not submitting action plans to prevent pollution
                    emanating from crop burning after the harvest season.
                </li>
                <li>It had directed the governments of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan to show how the
                    field staff of the departments concerned and the State pollution control boards were going to
                    control pollution caused by crop residue burning.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Penalty</strong>: The NGT had earlier fixed the environment penalty amounts per incident of
                    crop burning to be paid by <strong>small land owners</strong> having less than two acres of land at
                    Rs. <strong>2,500</strong>, <strong>medium land owners</strong> holding over two acres and less than

                    <strong>15,000</strong>.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Punitive action: </strong>It had also directed the State governments to take coercive and
                    punitive action against persistent defaulters and asked them to withdraw the assistance provided to
                    such farmers.

                <li><strong>Expert opinion: </strong>Air pollution is diminishing India’s capacity to harness power from
                    the sun.
                </li>
                <li><strong>New study by Scientists:</strong>S. and Indian scientists measured how man-made particles
                    floating in the air and deposited as grime on solar panels combined to seriously impair sunlight
                    from converting to energy.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Findings:</strong></li>
                <li>Sand and dust that sickens millions across India every year is also sapping solar power generation
                    by more than 25 percent.
                </li>
                <li>This interference causes steep drops in power generation</li>
                <li>At present levels in India, it could amount to roughly 3,900 MW of lost energy — six times the
                    capacity of its largest solar farm, a gigantic field of 2.5 million panels.

                <ul>
                    <li>Lidar (also called LIDAR, LiDAR, and LADAR) is a surveying method that measures distance to a
                        target by illuminating that target with a pulsed laser light, and measuring the reflected pulses
                        with a sensor.
                    </li>
                    <li>Differences in laser return times and wavelengths can then be used to make digital
                        representations of the target.

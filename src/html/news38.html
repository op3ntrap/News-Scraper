                <li>The NCAML was launched last month. The move comes in the wake of alleged government indifference to

                    judicial probe takes place and mandates life imprisonment for the for those convicted under mob
                    lynching.

                <li>The Karnataka State Commission for Backward Classes had convened a meeting to discuss the
                    implications of the Centre’s move to provide constitutional backing to the <strong>National
                        Commission for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (NCSEBC).</strong></li>
                <li>Meeting was attended by commission heads of Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and
                    Kerala.<strong> </strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Highlights of the meeting:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The chairpersons of backward classes commissions of southern States resolved to urge the Centre
                    against “interfering with the acts of inclusion into or exclusion from the list of socially backward
                    classes for the purpose reservation in any State”.
                </li>
                <li>The Bill that seeks to give constitution status to the NCSEBC, they argued, had provisions that were
                    contrary to the <strong>federal structure and undermined their powers.</strong></li>
                <li>The commission heads collectively urged the Centre against interfering in the process of extending
                    any benefit of reservation and other welfare measures within the State.
                </li>
                <li>They sought a review of all provisions that centralise the functions aimed at the welfare of
                    socially and educationally backward classes.
                </li>
                <li><strong>12 resolutions passed in the meeting:</strong> In one of the resolutions, they objected to
                    clauses which empower the NCSEBC to make it mandatory for every State government to consult the
                    national commission on all major policy matters.
                </li>
                <li>They demanded constitutional status for the State commissions on a par with the NCSEBC and the
                    National Commissions for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

                <li>conducted by the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) to identify ‘out-of-school’ children across Karnataka
                    ahead of the 2017–18 academic year.
                </li>
                <li>Nearly 63% of children who dropped out of school prior to the commencement of this academic year are
                    between the ages of 11 and 13, indicating that most leave the education system after completing
                    lower primary classes.
                </li>
                <li>The SSA identified 7,807 children between the ages of seven and 13 who had dropped out before the
                    start of the academic year. Another 511 are children who never enrolled in school. This brings the
                    total number of children in the State who have either dropped out of school or not enrolled in one
                    to 8,318.
                </li>
                <li>About 49% of the 7,807 children are those belonging to the Schedule Castes and Schedule Tribes
                    category; 48.9% are from minority communities and other backward classes. The maximum number of
                    out-of-school children are from Bengaluru Urban (1,739), followed by Kalaburagi (1,389). Vijayapura
                    district has the best record, reporting only seven such children.
                </li>
                <li>The fact that children are not completing their education has been in focus since April 2013 after
                    the High Court took suo motu cognisance of the issue.
                </li>

            <p><strong>G20:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The G20 (or G-20 or Group of Twenty) is an international forum for the governments and central bank
                    governors from 20 major economies.
                </li>
                <li>Founded in 1999, the G20 aims to discuss policy issues pertaining to the promotion of international
                    financial stability.
                </li>
                <li>It seeks to address issues that go beyond the responsibilities of any one organization.</li>
                <li>The G20 heads of government or heads of state have periodically conferred at summits since their
                    initial meeting in 2008, and the group also hosts separate meetings of finance ministers and foreign
                    ministers due to the expansion of its agenda in recent years.
                </li>
                <li>Membership of the G20 consists of 19 individual countries plus the European Union
                    (EU).<strong> </strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>FATF:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) was established in July 1989 by a Group of Seven (G-7) Summit
                    in Paris, initially to examine and develop measures to combat money laundering.
                </li>
                <li>In October 2001, the FATF expanded its mandate to incorporate efforts to combat terrorist financing,
                    in addition to money laundering.
                </li>
                <li><strong>The objectives of the FATF are to set standards and promote effective implementation of
                    legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating money laundering, terrorist financing and
                    other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system. </strong></li>
                <li>The FATF is therefore a “policy-making body” which works to generate the necessary political will to
                    bring about national legislative and regulatory reforms in these areas.
                </li>
                <li>The FATF monitors the progress of its members in implementing necessary measures, reviews money
                    laundering and terrorist financing techniques and counter-measures, and promotes the adoption and
                    implementation of appropriate measures globally.

            <ul>
                <li>Retail sale price shall be the maximum retail price (MRP) inclusive of all taxes, with the provision
                    to round off the price to the nearest rupee or 50 paise.
                </li>
                <li>No person shall declare different MRPs on an identical pre-packed commodity.</li>
                <li>Require sellers to enhance the size of letters and numerals for making declarations such as “best
                    before date, month and year” to indicate shelf life, for making it easier for consumers to read
                    vital information.

            <ul>
                <li>Farm loan waivers announced by several states will push up borrowings by at least Rs 1,50,000 crore
                    and raise the cost of funds for states, rating agencies have said
                </li>
                <li>Full funding of announced crop loan waivers through state development loans (SDL) could push up
                    fresh issuance to Rs 5,30,000 crore in FY18 from Rs 3,80,000 crore in FY17
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Mode of funding not clear:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is unclear whether the loan waivers would be funded through issuance of State Development Loans
                    (SDL) or other modes of financing, such as loans from banks to the state governments or bonds issued
                    by the latter to the banks
                </li>
                <li>If the funding of the announced waivers of Rs 88,170 crore is done entirely through SDL in FY2018
                    (which is unlikely), the issuance of fresh SDL could rise to Rs 5,30,000 crore in FY18
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Effects of SDL issuance:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The rise in SDL issuance would firm up their yields and widen their spread relative to Central
                    Government securities (G-sec) to above 100 bps during second half of FY2018
                </li>
                <li>The expected increase in SDL issuance is likely to contribute to crowding out the private sector
                    from accessing the bond markets at competitive rates
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Do states have desired fiscal capacity for farm loan waivers?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Punjab government lacks the fiscal space to accommodate the full funding of the loan waiver in
                    FY18
                </li>
                <li>Uttar Pradesh would have to curtail its budgeted capital expenditure by more than 70 per cent to
                    accommodate loan waiver
                </li>
                <li>Karnataka government appears to have the fiscal space to fully fund the crop loan waiver in FY18
                </li>
                <li>Maharashtra state government may lack the space to raise borrowings to fund the entire loan waiver
                    of Rs 34,000 crore in FY18, which may be on account of other spending that is not fully budgeted

            <p><strong>Basic Information:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>State Development loans</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>State Development Loans (SDLs) are dated securities issued by states for meeting their market
                    borrowings requirements. In effect, the SDL are similar to the dated securities issued by the
                    central government.
                </li>
                <li>Purpose of issuing State Development Loans is to meet the budgetary needs of state governments. Each
                    state can borrow upto a set limit through State Development Loans.

            <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
            <p>A  PIL has been filed against GM crops in the Supreme Court of India</p>
            <p><strong>Issues associated with GMO</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>GMOs carry risks of ‘unintended’ effects and toxicity and long term,health impacts such as cancer.
                </li>
                <li>GMOs are self-replicating organisms and genetic contamination of the environment, of non-GM crops
                    and wild species through gene flow
                </li>
                <li>It cannot be contained, reversed, remedied or quantified.</li>
                <li>Our seed stock will be contaminated at the molecular level.</li>
                <li>The traits for disease, saline and drought resistance, yield, etc. are found in nature, not biotech
                    labs.
                </li>
                <li>California reaffirmed glyphosate,included in a list of chemicals labelled as “cancer-causing”</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What is Glyphosate?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Glyphosate is one of the most widely used herbicides in the United States and considered the safest
                    herbicide.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Issues associated with Glyphosate</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Glyphosate is an endocrine (hormone) disruptor.</li>
                <li>But no regulatory agency regulates for endocrine disruption despite evidences from Argentina that it
                    causes birth defects because of glyphosate used herbicide-tolerant (HT)soybeans
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Concerns with GMOs in India?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bayer’s glufosinate, the herbicide linked with Indian HT mustard, is an acknowledged neurotoxin
                    banned in the EU.
                </li>
                <li>The Supreme Court-appointed technical expert committee recommended a ban on any HT crop in India
                </li>
                <li>The myths with GM crop technology that it “will feed the world” — are fast dissolving.</li>
                <li>The current GMOs, Bt cotton and HT on empirical evidence are proven unsustainable technologies.</li>
                <li>There are promises of GMOs with traits for disease, drought etc, but these are complex, multi-gene
                    traits and remain futuristic.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Where India lacks?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Serious lack of expertise in risk assessment, and we are sitting on an agri-biosecurity danger
                    situation.
                </li>
                <li>We have moved from dismal regulation in Bt cotton in 2002 to outright delinquency in commercialising
                    HT mustard.
                </li>
                <li>The regulation is subterranean, unconstitutional and also in contempt of Supreme Court orders
                    pertaining to Bt brinjal/mustard.

                                24 weeks.

                        <p><strong>Key Fact:</strong> Out of the 26 million births that occur in India every year,
                            approximately 2-3% had severe congenital or chromosomal abnormality</p>
                        <pre><strong>Basic Information:&#13;
&#13;
</strong><strong>What is MTP Act, 1971?&#13;
</strong>Abortion in India is legal only up to twenty weeks of pregnancy under specific conditions &#13;
and situations.&#13;
One, the continuance of the pregnancy would involve a risk to the life of the &#13;
pregnant woman or of grave injury of physical or mental health, or&#13;
Two, there is a substantial risk that if the child were born, it would suffer &#13;
from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped.&#13;
&#13;
<strong>What the draft MPT bill 2014 provides?&#13;
</strong>The draft MTP increased the legal limit for abortion from 20 weeks to 24 weeks.&#13;
It provides for abortion beyond 24 weeks under defined conditions.&#13;
The Bill amends Section 3 of the 1971 Act to provide that “the length of pregnancy shall &#13;
not apply” in a decision to abort a foetus diagnosed with “substantial foetal abnormalities” &#13;
or if it is “alleged by the pregnant woman to have been caused by rape”.&#13;
Under the 1971 Act, even pregnant rape victims cannot abort after 20 weeks, compelling &#13;
them to move court.&#13;
It allows a woman to take an independent decision in consultation with a registered &#13;
health-care provider.&#13;
It also takes into account the reality of a massive shortage of both doctors and &#13;
trained midwives, and seeks to allow Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha practitioners to carry &#13;
out abortions.<strong> &#13;
&#13;
</strong><strong>Why is it essential to change the MTP law?&#13;
</strong>Foetal abnormalities show up only by 18 weeks, so just a two-week window after &#13;
that is too small for the would-be parents to take the difficult call on whether to &#13;
keep their baby.&#13;
Even for the medical practitioner, this window is too small to exhaust all possible &#13;
options before advising the patient.&#13;
There is an urgent need to empower women with sexual rights, legal protection against &#13;
sex crimes and sex choices both in their own interest and for the sake of reducing the &#13;
fertility rate as a whole.&#13;
The lack of legal approval moves abortion to underground and they are done in &#13;
unhygienic conditions by untrained, thus, putting thousands of women at risk.</pre>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The World Health Organization has said that <strong>tuberculosis epidemic</strong> in
                                India was “larger” than what had been previously estimated and asserted that the country
                                was <strong>one of six nations</strong> which accounted for <strong>60% of the new
                                    cases</strong> in 2015.
                            </li>
                            <li>According to reports, the prevalence of TB in India was at <strong>217 per 1,00,000

                            <li>A notice issued by a health ministry expert committee in the first week of June signals
                                the government’s intention to usher major change in India’s pharmaceutical sector
                            </li>
                            <li>It invites comments from stakeholders about replacing widely-used animal parts-based
                                <strong>gelatin capsules</strong> with those derived from <strong>cellulose</strong>
                            </li>
                            <li>In 2015, the scientific committee which advises the Drug Controller General of India
                                (DGCI) gave an in-principle approval to the shift to cellulose-based capsules
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Current situation: </strong>Currently, 98 per cent of the Indian pharmaceutical
                            industry uses animal parts-based capsules</p>
                        <p><strong>What government wants?</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Government has been pitching for “vegetarian capsules” for the past two years</li>
                            <li>But there is little medical or commercial reasoning behind this proposal</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>What this could lead to?</strong></p>
                        <p>A switch over to cellulose-based capsules could jeopardise the government’s recent
                            initiatives to make medicines accessible to all.</p>
                        <p><strong>Difference in opinions:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In an e-mail last year to the joint secretary, health ministry, the DGCI pitched for
                                “vegetable capsules for vegetarian society”
                            </li>
                            <li>The DGCI’s vegetarian fetish found support from the Women and Child Development Minister
                                Maneka Gandhi
                            </li>
                            <li>She argued, “In a country where there are millions of people, this hurts religious
                                sentiments and many people avoid medicines that are in a capsule form”
                            </li>
                            <li>The Drug Technical Advisory Board, health ministry’s premier advisory agency, had
                                dismissed Gandhi’s representation on the grounds that: “Unlike food, drugs are not taken
                                as choice but are prescribed by doctors to save lives and marking them as vegetarian or
                                non-vegetarian is not desirable”
                            </li>
                            <li>The health ministry has overruled this reasoning</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Concerns/opinions of industry:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>They have argued that the gelatin capsules have been in use all over the world for more
                                than 180 years
                            </li>
                            <li>They also questioned viability of cellulose-based capsules</li>
                            <li>Various industry associations cited the huge economic cost of the switch, which may also
                                impact accessibility of medicines
                            </li>
                            <li>The cost of raw material required to make cellulose capsules is approximately four times
                                that of gelatin and the manufacturing cost of cellulose-based capsules approximately
                                three times the cost of gelatin capsules
                            </li>

</strong><strong>Kepler Mission&#13;
</strong>Kepler is a space observatory launched by NASA to discover Earth-size planets &#13;
orbiting other stars&#13;
Named after astronomer Johannes Kepler&#13;
It was launched into an Earth-trailing heliocentric orbit&#13;
Kepler is part of NASA’s Discovery Program of relatively low-cost, focused primary &#13;
science missions&#13;
The scientific objective of Kepler is to explore the structure and diversity of &#13;
planetary systems&#13;
<strong>This spacecraft observes:&#13;
</strong>To determine how many Earth-size and larger planets there are in or near the habitable &#13;
zone <strong>(often called “Goldilocks planets”)&#13;
</strong>To determine the range of size and shape of the orbits of these planets&#13;
To estimate how many planets there are in multiple-star systems&#13;
To determine the range of orbit size, brightness, size, mass and density of short-period &#13;
giant planets&#13;
To identify additional members of each discovered planetary system using other techniques&#13;
Determine the properties of those stars that harbor planetary systems</pre>

                                            simply the habitable zone (Goldilocks Zone), is the region around a star
                                            within which planetary-mass objects with sufficient atmospheric pressure can
                                            support liquid water at their surfaces. Researchers are finding that life

                                        <p>The People’s Republic of China and Israel are not members, but they have
                                            aligned their export controls with Wassenaar lists, and are significant arms
                                            exporters. </p>
                                        <p><strong>New amendment</strong>: In December 2013, the list of export
                                            restricted technologies was amended to include <strong>internet-based
                                                surveillance systems.</strong> New technologies placed under the export
                                            control regime include “intrusion software”—software designed to defeat a
                                            computer or network’s protective measures so as to extract data or
                                            information—as well as IP network surveillance systems.</p></div>

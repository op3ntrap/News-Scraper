            <ul>
                <li><strong>Exception 2 to Section 375 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code</strong> (IPC): allowed the
                    husband of a girl child — between 15 and 18 years of age — blanket liberty and freedom to have
                    non-consensual sexual intercourse with her. Her willingness or consent was of no concern.
                </li>
                <li>The husband in such cases was not punished for rape.<strong> </strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>In news:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Supreme Court’s</strong> <strong>historic</strong> <strong>verdict: </strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sexual intercourse by a man with his wife, who is below 18 years of age, is rape.</li>
                        <li>A girl child below the age of 18 cannot be treated as a commodity having no say over her
                            body or someone who has no right to deny sexual intercourse to her husband.
                        </li>
                        <li>Human rights of a girl child are very much alive and kicking whether she is married or not
                            and deserve recognition and acceptance
                        </li>
                        <li>The court, however, refrained from dealing with the issue of marital rape of a woman aged
                            above 18.
                        </li>
                        <li>The exception clause to rape, carved out in the IPC, created an unnecessary and artificial
                            distinction between a married girl child and an unmarried girl child.
                        </li>
                        <li>The clause took away the right of a girl child to bodily integrity and reproductive choice.
                            It had even the effect of turning a blind eye to trafficking of the minor girl children in
                            the guise of marriage.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Exception 2 to Section 375 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code &amp; statutory rape : </strong>The
                    exception had remained an anomaly because Section 375 itself mandated that sex with a girl below 18
                    years of age, with or without her consent, was <strong>statutory rape.</strong> An unmarried girl
                    child can prosecute her rapist, but a married girl child aged between 15 and 18 could not even do
                    that
                </li>
                <li><strong>Expert opinion: </strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>With this judgment, considered by experts as trigger to declaring child marriage <strong>void
                            ab initio</strong>, the court ended the decades-old disparity between Exception 2 to Section
                            375 IPC and other child protection laws.
                        </li>
                        <li>These include the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act of 2006, Protection of Children from
                            Sexual Offences Act and Juvenile Justice Act, all which define a “child” as someone who is
                            below 18 years of age.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What is the conflict between IPC 375 and POCSO Act?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Almost every statute in India recognises that a girl below 18 years of age is a child and it is for
                    this reason that the law penalises sexual intercourse with a girl who is below 18 years of age.
                </li>
                <li>Exception 2 to Section 375 of the IPC: if a girl child between 15 and 18 years of age is married,
                    her husband can have non-consensual sexual intercourse with her, without being penalised under the
                    IPC, only because she is married to him and for no other reason.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Prohibition of Child Marriage Act:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>PCMA makes child marriage only voidable, that is, the burden is placed on the child bride to
                    approach a court to declare her marriage a nullity.
                </li>
                <li>She has to do this within two years of attaining majority that is by the time she is 20 years old.
                </li>
                <li>If not, the marriage continues.<strong> </strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Will previous cases of child marriages/rape be reconsidered?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The judgment will have “prospective effect” meaning it will not apply to past cases</li>
                <li>Cognizance of such offenses can be taken only in accordance with the provisions of section 198(6) of
                    the Criminal Procedure Code
                </li>
                <li>The provision says that court shall not take cognizance of an offense under Section 376 IPC “if more
                    than one year has elapsed from the date of commission of the offense”
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Does this judgment apply to women above 18 years of age also?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The SC bench clarified that it was not making any observation on “marital rape” of a woman who is 18
                    years of age and above as the issue was not before the court
                </li>
                <li>The question whether marital rape should be criminalized is pending before the Delhi High Court
                    where the Centre has filed an affidavit opposing this saying that doing so may destabilize the
                    institution of marriage apart from being an easy tool for harassing husbands

            <ul>
                <li>Exception 2 of Section 375 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code allows a husband to have sexual
                    intercourse with his minor wife, with or without her consent, if she has crossed the age of 15.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What is the reason for fixing the magic figure of 15 years?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>In the year 1940, when the age of consent for sexual intercourse for a girl was 16 years, the age of
                    marriage was 15 years and the age under the exception was also 15 years.
                </li>
                <li>In 1975, too, the age of consent was 16 years, the age of marriage was 18 years, but the age under
                    the exception remained 15 years.
                </li>
                <li>Today, when the age of consent and marriage of a girl are both 18, the age under the exception
                    clause is frozen at 15 years.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Inference:</strong> The magic figure of 15 years is not based on any scientific evaluation,
                    but is based on the mere fact that it has been existing for a long time. It strikes against the
                    concept of equality. It violates the right of fair treatment of the girl child, who is unable to
                    look after herself.

        <div id="‘Living Will’ can take effect only if a medical board certifies a person condition is irreversible: Supreme Court">
            <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Supreme Court is hearing a petition by NGO Independent Thought to legalize
                    <strong>euthanasia</strong> and the <strong>concept of ‘Living Will’</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>Five-judge Constitution Bench, headed by Chief Justice, is debating on when exactly a person’s
                    ‘Living Will’ or advance directive for end-of-life medical care should take effect.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>In news:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Court’s observation: </strong>A person’s advance directive to withdraw medical care to allow
                    him to die with dignity should take effect only when a <strong>medical board affirms</strong> that
                    his condition is beyond cure and irreversible.
                </li>
                <li>The Bench said it would lay down guidelines for drafting living wills and how it can be
                    authenticated. It has reserved the case for judgment.
                </li>
                <li>Advance directives may be approved by a magistrate. The magistrate has to examine that the person
                    executing the ‘Living Will’ is of sound mind. That he has taken informed consent.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> If a man is admitted to a hospital and he goes into coma. The hospital
                    informs the medical board, which takes a fair, informed and impartial decision that his medical
                    condition is beyond cure. This decision is taken by the medical board on the touchstone of modern
                    technology.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Two-fold test</strong> as to when a <strong>‘Living Will’</strong> would come into effect:
                    <ul>
                        <li>When the medical condition of the patient has become irreversible.</li>
                        <li>When the prolongation of his life can be done only at the cost of pain and suffering which
                            is at a level inconsistent with his advance directive.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Government’s response:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The legalization of ‘advance directives’ would amount to waiving of the paramount
                            fundamental right to life enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution.
                        </li>
                        <li>Government was opposing the concept of ‘Living Will’ as a principle of public policy. It
                            said the State’s primary obligation is to sustain life and not legalise a person’s wish to
                            die.
                        </li>
                        <li>The government had said the passive euthanasia is the law of the land, with thousands of
                            cases in which doctors withdraw life support after getting the informed consent of the
                            relatives.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>

            <p><strong>Highlights of a study in the Lancet:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The study was released on World Obesity Day on October 11</li>
                <li>The study looked at BMI (body mass index) trends in 200 countries from 1975-2016</li>
                <li><strong>Obese Population: </strong>It has found that the number of obese girls in age group 5-19 has
                    risen from 5 million to 50 million in 40 years. And that of boys from 6 million to 74 million.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Underweight Polpulation: </strong>The researchers say that if current world trends continue,
                    “obese” will soon be more common than “underweight”
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Scenario in India:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>India has among the largest shares of underweight children and teenagers</li>
                <li>And at the other end, it is part of a trend that has seen the number of obese under-20s worldwide
                    rising tenfold in 10 years
                </li>
                <li>In India, the prevalence of obesity is between 1-2 %</li>
                <li>The prevalence of mild to severe underweight under-20s in India is 22.7% among girls and 30.7% among
                    boys
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Obesity among children:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The middle class and upper middle class in India have fewer children and tend to overfeed them under
                    the pretext of pampering
                </li>
                <li>As per the Lancet study, the percentage is between 1-2 in India but these will increase as social
                    structures are changing in India

                <li>India had sent <strong>Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar</strong> on an unannounced visit to the
                    seychelles
                </li>
                <li><strong>Possible reasons behind this move:</strong> Due to concerns arise from China’s moves and
                    increasing presence in Seychelles and to iron out differences over the development of infrastructure

            <p><strong>Seychelles response:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Seychelles has said it would like to take a “relook” at the agreement between the two countries to
                    build military infrastructure on Assumption Island
                </li>
                <li>The agreement was signed during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Seychelles in 2015</li>
                <li>Officials in Seychelles have said the agreement does not have legal backing on their side, whereas
                    it has legal basis in India
                </li>
                <li>To avoid returning to the negotiating table, Jaishankar met Seychelles President Danny Faure and
                    discussed the hurdles that have come up in recent months

                    People’s Defence Forces (SPDF) on Assumption Island
                </li>
                <li>The infrastructure also includes residential barracks for SPDF’s Coast Guard and fixing up the jetty

            <ul>
                <li>The two countries have an established relationship in defence and maritime security, through which
                    India helps to patrol the waters of Seychelles and gives equipment to the island nation’s defence
                    forces
                </li>
                <li>In recent years, India has agreed to help Seychelles map its hydrology reserves, launched a coastal
                    surveillance radar project and boosted security cooperation with the nation

            <ul>
                <li>The Cabinet approved a cargo-swapping arrangement with Japan as part of a broader bilateral pact to
                    create a gas exchange that could reduce India’s logistical costs for natural gas import.
                </li>
                <li>As the world’s largest importer of gas, Japan has pacts for supply with Qatar. India is having
                    similar pacts with Australia.
                </li>
                <li><strong>What is the deal all about? </strong>As part of the gas exchange, India will have a
                    provision that will allow the swapping of these gas contracts which will save [on] transport costs.
                    So, that India can get gas from Qatar instead of Japan and Japan can source our quantum from
                    Australia.
                </li>
                <li>It is purely for logistics costs. It is a swapping of cargo and not of contracts, so the tariff at
                    which the LNG is bought will not change.

                <li>Steps to manage the currency volatility.</li>
                <li>Excessive exchange rate volatility could affect investment and growth possibilities in tradable
                    sectors.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Capital flows:</strong> Capital flows refer to the movement of money for the purpose of
                    investment, trade, including the flow of capital within corporations in the form of capital spending
                    on operations and research and development (R&amp;D).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Background information:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The latest World Economic Outlook report by the IMF shows that it has been tough for the central
                    banks to manage currency market.
                </li>
                <li>The exchange rate volatility has become a significant problem from the year 2013 when the US Federal
                    Reserve hinted that it could reduce its interest rates. This led to sudden capital outflow from the
                    emerging markets including India. In 2015, the devaluation of renminbi also had a similar effect on
                    the international economy although India was insulated from this shock.
                </li>
                <li>Capital flows are fairly volatile, non-intervention from the central bank can affect economic
                    activity and could be a potential source of risk to financial stability.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Way forward measures:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The central bank should continue to intervene in the market to protect the competitiveness of the
                    rupee. This means the RBI should undertake purchase of foreign currencies.
                </li>
                <li>Now that India has adequate reserves, the government and the RBI should review the composition of
                    foreign flows. Equity investment is more stable compared to debt which sometimes flows in only
                    because of interest rate arbitrage.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Basic Information:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Current Account Deficit:</strong> A capital account deficit shows that more money is flowing
                    out of the economy along with increase in its ownership of foreign assets and vice-versa in case of
                    a surplus.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Real Effective Exchange Rate</strong>: The real effective exchange rate (REER) is the
                    weighted average of a country’s currency relative to an index or basket of other major currencies,
                    adjusted for the effects of inflation.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Market intervention by the RBI:</strong> Purchase of foreign currencies will lead to
                    decrease in supply of the same. This will increase the rupee supply in the market and help
                    appreciation of foreign currencies leading to increase in competitiveness of Indian rupee.

            <p><strong>In news:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Three marine species, the <strong>Pondicherry Shark, the Red Sea Torpedo and the Tentacled Butterfly
                    Ray </strong>might have become possibly extinct in the oceanic waters of the <strong>Arabian Seas
                    Region</strong> (ASR) since no evidence of its existence has surfaced in the last three decades.
                </li>
                <li>Scientists are also worried about the possible disappearance of other species from the region even
                    before they were known to science.
                </li>
                <li>The first ever assessment of the conservation status of sharks, rays, and chimaeras (collectively
                    called chondrichthyans) in the region has left the scientists grim-faced as 78 of the 153 species
                    revived were found fighting for survival.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Critically Endangered: </strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Guitar fish found in coastal waters of Kerala and Tamil Nadu and</li>
                        <li>the Ganges Shark found in Arabian Sea</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Arabian Seas Region</strong> The ASR covers the waters of the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, Arabian
                    Sea, Sea of Oman, and the Persian Gulf. The region is also bordered by 20 countries including India,
                    Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Israel and Pakistan.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Key Fact:</strong> India has banned the exploitation and trade of 10 species of sharks and
                    rays. In 2015, India even banned the export and import of shark fins of all species.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Reasons:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>By-catch was found to be the biggest threat to the majority of chondrichthyan fishes besides
                            the “pressure from artisanal and industrial fisheries.”
                        </li>
                        <li>Increasing decline in the extent and quality of habitat as a result of coastal development
                            and other anthropogenic disturbances, particularly for those critical habitats that many
                            species depend on coral reefs, mangroves, sea grasses pose a serious threat to the survival
                            of many species.

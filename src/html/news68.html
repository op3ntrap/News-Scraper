                <li>The Kannada Development Authority (KDA) urged the Centre to conduct competitive examinations in all
                    official languages of States.
                </li>
                <li>KDA Chairman S.G. Siddaramaiah said the current policy has proved detrimental to the interests of
                    people of various States and regions. He said that “the very fabric of federalism needs to be better
                    appreciated in this selection as well as in any Central government recruitment process.”
                </li>
                <li><strong>Demands proposed:</strong></li>
                <li>Besides Central civil service examinations, all competitive examinations of national level,
                    especially banking services, must be held in official languages of States.
                </li>
                <li>In the recruitment to any job of Central, semi-government and public sectors, candidates should be
                    allowed to choose question papers and answer in languages identified in the 8th Schedule of the
                    Constitution, he said.
                </li>
                <li>The use of English should be restricted to compulsory English paper in order to avoid unwarranted
                    English supremacy.

            <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Tamil Nadu Assembly recently voted to double the salaries of its legislators</li>
                <li>Maharashtra’s Assembly passed a Bill in 2016 that raised the monthly salary of its MLAs to above
                    that of the President (Rs. 1.5 lakh per month)
                </li>
                <li>India paid 2.7 lakh a month, which includes salaries and expenses, to every Member of Parliament in
                    2015.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Global examples</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Public representatives in developing countries in Africa and Asia are routinely paid far above per
                    capita GDP
                </li>
                <li>Nigeria, pays its lawmakers more than 100 times its per capita GDP while in Kenya, its legislators
                    get 76 times its per capita GDP.
                </li>
                <li>Gross salary of an Italian lawmaker is the second highest among developed countries after the U.S
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What’s the situation in India?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>India’s initial start was promising. The first cabinet meeting of Jawaharlal Nehru took a collective
                    decision not to avail of their salaries for six months, given the enormous economic suffering in
                    India then.
                </li>
                <li>Today, parliamentary representatives have arrogated the authority to increase their own fiscal
                    compensation by 1,250% over the last two decades — a case of questionable moral rectitude.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Main concern?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Allowances should be in proportion to the services that they have rendered to the nation, but in the
                    past two decades, Parliament has seen less than 50% of Bills being scrutinised by parliamentary
                    committees, defeating the very purpose of a deliberative Parliament
                </li>
                <li>Money Bills, like those associated with Aadhaar, have been passed without being referred to a
                    committee.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>A survey of parliamentary salaries</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It was conducted in 2013 by the Inter-Parliamentary Union across 104 Parliaments highlighted that
                    salaries in about 55% are linked to a structured scale, typically linked to the civil service
                    (France, Japan) or ministerial salaries
                </li>
                <li>Mature democracies typically have separate independent bodies to establish parliamentary salaries;
                    such as the Remuneration Tribunal in Australia or the Independent Commission for the Remuneration of
                    Public Office Bearers in South Africa.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong> Way forward</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Instead of seeking pay in line with the private sector, India’s public representatives should be
                    paid a reasonable wage, which offers gratitude for their commitment to life as a public servant
                </li>
                <li>Require an external, independent body to determine parliamentary salaries.</li>
                <li>Salary reviews should be conducted through an institutionalised process</li>
                <li>Increments should be determined through a transparent and accountable process</li>
                <li>The issue of decline in parliamentary sittings could be partially alleviated by linking salaries to
                    a minimum attendance of parliamentary sessions
                </li>

                <li>Indian Institute of Science researchers have developed a highly sensitive nanometer-scale <strong>carbon
                    monoxide sensor</strong> by employing an innovative fabrication technique.
                </li>
                <li>Carbon monoxide (CO) can have adverse effects on the health of people exposed to it. Hence, it
                    becomes necessary to have good, low-cost carbon-monoxide sensors.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Working principle</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Typically, a sensor would be a thin, current carrying plate whose resistance changes on exposure to
                    carbon monoxide. This in turn changes the value of the current flowing through it. This change when
                    measured indicates the level of carbon monoxide in the air.
                </li>
                <li>Most available sensors are in the micrometer range, a nanometer-sized detector would have a higher
                    sensitivity, but the cost of manufacturing it goes up as the size decreases.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Smart cities and nano-sensors</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has a vision of deploying such sensors in
                    large scale for pollution monitoring in large cities like Delhi and Bengaluru.
                </li>
                <li>If the sensors are installed in all traffic intersections, we can do real time mapping of pollution
                    hot-spots in a city. This would be an enabler in realizing smart cities.

        <div id="Editing ourselves">
            <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Scientists have for the first time managed to edit genes in a human embryo to repair a genetic
                    mutation.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Solution to genetic mutation</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Scientists fixed a mutation that thickens the heart muscle, a condition called hypertrophic
                    cardiomyopathy.
                </li>
                <li>The cardiac disease causes sudden death in otherwise healthy young athletes and affects about one in
                    500 people overall.
                </li>
                <li>It is caused by a mutation in a particular gene and a child will suffer from the condition even if
                    it inherits only one copy of the mutated gene.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Significance of the research:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Correcting the mutation in the gene would not only ensure that the child is healthy but it would
                    also prevent the mutation from being passed on to future generations
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Other concerns</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Though the research marks a major milestone in genome editing of embryos, it will be a long while
                    before it becomes available as a tool to produce healthy embryos.
                </li>
                <li>Even research on embryos using federal funding is not permitted in the U.S., where the research was
                    carried out.
                </li>
                <li>The embryos were produced with the clear intention of using them solely for research and not for
                    implanting them in women.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Advantages of gene editing</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Several diseases can potentially be prevented by using this technique, including some cancers.</li>
                <li>CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing tool is safe for preventing certain hereditary disease-causing mutations,
                    for which no other treatment is available.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Issue</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The main issue is the prospect of developing designer babies through gene editing.</li>

                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                    <p>India’s first bio-refinery plant has been inaugurated by the Union Minister for Road Transport
                        and Highway Nitin Gadkari at Rahu in Pune district, Maharashtra. The plant will produce ethanol
                        from variety of biomass. The bio‐refinery plant is capable of producing one million litre of
                        ethanol per annum by processing a variety of agro-residue like rice and wheat straw, cotton
                        stalk, cane trash, corn cobs with superior product yields. Biofuel is cost‐effective and
                        pollution‐free.</p></div>

                    issue from the viewpoint of environmental ethics.
                </li>
                <li>You are working as an Executive Engineer in the construction cell of a Municipal Corporation and are
                    presently in-charge of the construction of a flyover. There are two Junior Engineers under you who
                    have the responsibility of day-to-day inspection of the site and are reporting to you, while you are
                    finally reporting to the Chief Engineer who heads the cell. While the construction is heading
                    towards completion, the Junior Engineers have been regularly reporting that all construction is
                    taking place as per design specifications. However, in one of your surprise inspections, you have
                    noticed some serious deviations and lacunae which, in your opinion, are likely to affect the safety
                    of the flyover. Rectification of these lacunae at this stage would require a substantial amount of
                    demolition and rework which will cause a tangible loss to the contractor and will also delay
                    completion. There is a lot of public pressure on the Corporation to get this construction completed
                    because of heavy traffic congestion in the area. When you brought this matter to the notice of the
                    Chief Engineer, he advised you that in his opinion it is not a very serious lapse and may be
                    ignored. He advised for further expediting the project for completion in time. However, you are
                    convinced that this was a serious matter which might affect public safety and should not be left
                    unaddressed.<br/>
                    What will you do in such a situation? Some of the options are given below. Evaluate the merits and
                    demerits of each of these options and finally suggest what course of action you would like to take,
                    giving reasons. (20 marks |250 words)

                            your own viewpoints stated clearly and seeks for written orders from the chief Engineer.

                            necessary correction within targeted time.

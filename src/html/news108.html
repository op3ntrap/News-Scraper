                <li>Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe laid the foundation stone in
                    Ahmedabad for the country’s first Rs. 1,10,000 crore, <strong>508 km </strong>high-speed rail
                    project between Mumbai and Ahmedabad.
                </li>
                <li><strong>The ambitious project is being implemented with nearly 90% financial support and technology
                    from Japan.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Key Fact: </strong>To be built on elevated corridor with a seven-km undersea tunnel in
                    Mumbai, the project will be based on the famed Japanese <strong>Shinkansen high-speed
                        railway</strong> system with a record of zero casualties in its 50 years of operation.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Dead line for completion: </strong>August 15, 2022, the day when India marks 75 years of
                    Independence.
                </li>
                <li>The project will be executed through a special purpose vehicle, the National High Speed Rail
                    Corporation Ltd.
                </li>
                <li>India’s Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd and Japan’s Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd will tie up for
                    manufacturing the rolling stock for bullet train project.
                </li>
                <li>A training centre in Vadodara is being set up to train over 4,000 employees who will be responsible
                    for execution, operation and maintenance of the bullet train.
                </li>
                <li>The project will cover 12 stations — Mumbai, Thane, Virar, Boisar, Vapi, Bilimora, Surat, Bharuch,
                    Vadodara, Anand, Ahmedabad and Sabarmati — and once operational, the train is expected to service
                    1.5 crore travellers a year.

        <div id="Five">
            <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Construction of the first bullet train between Ahmedabad and Mumbai is happening on 14 September at
                    a function attended by Narendra Modi and Shinzo Abe
                </li>
                <li>It is a major leap in infrastructure development in India, this project signifies the friendship and
                    collaboration between India and Japan
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Specialties:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The 534-km Rs1 trillion high-speed rail project will operate trains with average speeds of
                    200-250kmph
                </li>
                <li>It will be a game-changer in terms of inter-urban connectivity and establish India as a market for
                    such technologies
                </li>
                <li>Japan is providing a loan that would cover 80% of the estimated project cost at 5% interest, with a
                    15-year moratorium followed by a 35-year payback period.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges </strong></p>
            <p><strong>Route design which would include questions like</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Detailed alignment choice, especially when it is over ground, keeping in view land acquisition
                    challenges versus providing access to the population along the corridor.
                </li>
                <li>Generate urban growth around the station, and even shift the centre of gravity of the urban area.
                </li>
                <li>Number of stations: Demand for more stations would increase the catchment and reduce the average
                    speed due to higher number of stops. One option is to have different service categories like fast
                    (stopping at all stations) and super-fast (only at major cities).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Evacuation facilitation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Efficient bus services as well as accessible parking lots for private vehicles should be provided.
                </li>
                <li>At major stations, where passengers could move to other trains, th transfer must be seamless.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Land acquisition:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>This will be a critical issue, especially where the alignment would veer off from existing railway
                    lands.
                </li>
                <li>It would be best addressed by the line ging over ground, where the actual acquisition would be
                    limited
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Human resource development:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It would be important to train a large number of Indian engineers and managers for design,
                    construction and operations at standards that would be essential for high speed rail, including for
                    stringent safety standards
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Future expansion:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It would be useful to have a perspective on how the expansion of this line would happen.</li>

            </ul>
            <p><strong>In news:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>During the visit Shinzo Abe highlighted the country’s intensifying focus on the Indo-Pacific region
                    and Tokyo’s evolving foreign policy.
                </li>
                <li>Japan’s new concept- <strong>“Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy”:</strong></li>
                <li>Aims to prepare Japan to deal with the fast changing global and regional order and threats from
                    China and North Korea.
                </li>
                <li>Strategy aims to create a “free and open” Asia-Pacific region which connects parts of eastern
                    Africa, south Asia and southeast Asia with the western Pacific Ocean region and Japan.
                </li>
                <li>The ‘Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy’ rests on “two oceans” — Indian and Pacific — and “two
                    continents” — Africa and Asia.
                </li>
                <li>Connectivity between Asia and Africa through a free and open Indo-Pacific, is expected to support
                    stability and prosperity of the region.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Inference:</strong> by connecting “two oceans” and “two continents”, Japan is quietly
                    challenging China’s aggressive plans in the South China Sea that pose a threat to the energy lane
                    that sustains Japanese economy.

                <li>The AAGC is an economic cooperation agreement between the governments of India and Japan</li>
                <li>It engages various stakeholders- governments, firms, think tanks and civil society</li>

                <li>Enhancing capacities and skills, and</li>

                <li>The strengths of AAGC will be aligned with the development priorities of different countries and
                    sub-regions of Asia and Africa
                </li>
                <li>AAGC-led growth in Africa and Asia will be responsive to the collective commitment to Sustainable
                    Development Goals (SDGs)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Trade Facilitation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>In a study conducted by the European Commission, it is found that the time taken for export and
                    import activities is among the highest in Africa (excluding the northern region)
                </li>
                <li>Moreover, the documents required to export and import are also on the higher side in Africa</li>
                <li>According to OECD trade facilitation indicators, Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa are below the best
                    practices
                </li>
                <li>However, achieving the desired level of trade facilitation is a challenging task for Africa and Asia
                    because of lack of technical know-how and skills
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>India’s role:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>India has already made efforts through various initiatives to develop capabilities in other
                    countries in Asia and Africa in the past
                </li>
                <li>Although many of them are not fully developed due to paucity of resources</li>
                <li>But we can re-energize such projects/initiatives through AAGC funding that could lead to promotion
                    of imports and exports
                </li>
                <li>India must evolve appropriate strategy to meet import and export requirements of partner countries
                    in the medium term
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Reasons for low level growth in Africa:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The low level of private investment in Africa is withholding high growth</li>
                <li>Owing to risky projects on long gestation projects, there has been lukewarm response from
                    investors
                </li>
                <li>Possible Solution: Private investors may be attracted by using limited state funding using the
                    European Investment Fund (EIF) Model
                </li>
                <li>The EIF consists of subsidizing investment, loss protection, capital relief, reduced interest rate,
                    low collateral requirements, lease and guarantee
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Way forward:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Working closely with the international community, the Asia Africa Growth Corridor will be
                    instrumental in realizing a free and open Indo-Pacific region

                <p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Mathura School of art</strong></p>
                <p>At Sanchi, Barhut or Gaya, Buddha was never depicted in a human form but was represented only as a
                    symbol of either two footprints or wheel.</p>
                <p>Artisans from Mathura initially continued the Mauryan sculptural forms of the Yaksha and Yakshi,
                    until a human image of Buddha appeared, which was independent of other schools of art, but later
                    influenced by the Gandhara School.</p>
                <p>The representations of the Buddha in Mathura, in central northern India, are generally dated slightly
                    later than those of Gandhara.</p>
                <p><strong>Influence on Amaravati Art</strong></p>
                <p>The influence of Greek art can be felt beyond Mathura, as far as Amaravati on the East coast of
                    India, as shown by the usage of Greek scrolls in combination with Indian deities. Other motifs such
                    as Greek chariots pulled by four horses can also be found in the same area.</p>
                <p><strong>Gandhara School of Art / Greco-Buddhist art</strong></p>
                <p>Greco-Buddhist art is the artistic manifestation of Greco-Buddhism, a cultural syncretism between the
                    Classical Greek culture and Buddhism, which developed over a period of close to thousand years in
                    Central Asia, between the conquests of Alexander the Great in the 4th century BC, and the Islamic
                    conquests of the 7th century AD.</p></div>

                <li><strong>NGO’s (Independent thought), petition before Supreme Court:</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Challenged Exception 2</strong> to <strong>Section 375 (rape) of the Indian Penal
                    Code</strong>, which permits “sexual intercourse with a girl child aged between 15 and 18 only on
                    the ground that she is married”.
                </li>
                <li>The statutory exception to rape was violative of right to life, personal liberty, equality and is
                    discriminatory.
                </li>
                <li>The Exception is part of the <strong>Criminal Law (Amendment) Act of 2013</strong> and is contrary
                    to the anti-child sex abuse law, <strong>Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act of 2012
                        (POCSO).</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Supreme court’s question to government:</strong></li>
                <li>What is the logic behind keeping different minimum ages for marriage under different laws?</li>
                <li><strong>Basis Information:</strong> The age of consent varies from the Indian Penal Code to the
                    Prohibition of Child Marriage Act to the Hindu Marriage Act
                </li>
                <li><strong>Government response: </strong>The legislature may have taken a conscious decision to retain
                    the minimum age range for marriage <strong>between 15 and 18</strong> for girls considering the
                    <strong>socio-economic</strong> conditions of the country.<strong> </strong></li>

                    <p><strong>Section 375 in The Indian Penal Code</strong></p>
                    <p><strong> 375.Rape.—A man is said to commit “rape” who, except in the case hereinafter</strong>
                        excepted, has sexual intercourse with a woman under circumstances falling under any of the six
                        following de­-scriptions:—</p>
                    <p>(First) — Against her will.</p>
                    <p>(Secondly) —Without her consent.</p>
                    <p>(Thirdly) — With her consent, when her consent has been obtained by putting her or any person in
                        whom she is interested in fear of death or of hurt.</p>
                    <p>(Fourthly) —With her consent, when the man knows that he is not her husband, and that her consent
                        is given because she believes that he is another man to whom she is or believes herself to be
                        law­fully married.</p>
                    <p>(Fifthly) — With her consent, when, at the time of giving such consent, by reason of unsoundness
                        of mind or intoxication or the administration by him personally or through another of any
                        stupe­fying or unwholesome substance, she is unable to understand the nature and consequences of
                        that to which she gives consent.</p>
                    <p>(Sixthly) — With or without her consent, when she is under sixteen years of age.
                        Explanation.—Penetration is sufficient to constitute the sexual intercourse necessary to the
                        offence of rape.</p>
                    <p><strong>(Exception) —Sexual intercourse by a man with his wife, the wife not being under fifteen
                        years of age, is not rape.]</strong></p></div>

            <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code: </strong>a colonial era provision criminalising
                    consensual sexual acts of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) adults in private.
                </li>
                <li>The Supreme Court is likely to hear <strong>curative petitions</strong> against Section 377.</li>
                <li>The fight against Section 377 got a major boost when a <strong>nine-judge Bench of the Supreme
                    Court</strong>, while upholding the right to privacy as a fundamental right intrinsic to life and
                    liberty, ripped apart a 2014 judgment dismissing the case against Section 377 of the Indian Penal
                    Code, which criminalises consensual sexual acts of adults in private.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What is section 377?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Section 377. Unnatural offences:</strong> Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against
                    the order of nature with any man, woman or animal shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or
                    with imprisonment of either description for term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be
                    liable to fine.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Petitioner’s contention: </strong>The petitioners have contended that homosexuality was not a
                mental disorder, but a normal and natural variant of human sexuality</p>
            <p><strong>List of Cases and their verdict:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Naz Foundation v. Govt. of NCT of Delhi</strong>– is a landmark Indian case decided by a
                    two-judge bench of the Delhi High Court, which held that treating consensual homosexual sex between
                    adults as a crime is a violation of fundamental rights protected by India’s Constitution. The
                    verdict resulted in the decriminalization of homosexual acts involving consenting adults, in the
                    jurisdiction of the Delhi High court. This was later challenged in the Supreme Court of India.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Suresh Kumar Koushal (2013) Case Observations:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Supreme Court has upheld the validity of Section 377 of Indian Penal Code.</li>
                        <li>LGBT “<strong>minuscule minority”:</strong> no need to challenge Section 377 because the
                            LGBT community constitutes only a minuscule minority.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>National Legal Services Authority (2014) Case observations:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Transgenders, even though insignificant in numbers, are entitled to human rights.</li>
                        <li>Section 377 had been an instrument of harassment and abuse.</li>
                        <li>Discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity must end. Sexual orientation
                            is not only a freedom flowing from the right to privacy, but also a demanding of
                            non-discriminatory treatment
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Adoption of the Yogyakarta Principles</strong> — norms on gender identity and sexual
                            orientation adopted by human rights experts in 2006 in Indonesia.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Latest: In the Aadhaar case the Supreme Court Observations are as follows:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It has upheld the right to privacy as a fundamental right and an inherent component of human
                            liberty and dignity.
                        </li>
                        <li>The nine-judge Bench has observed that the rationale behind the Koushal judgment is flawed
                            and unsustainable.
                        </li>
                        <li>Rights of LGBT persons are real rights founded on sound constitutional doctrine and not
                            “so-called rights” as the earlier Bench had described.
                        </li>
                        <li>Sexual orientation is an aspect of the right to privacy and an inalienable part of human
                            dignity, freedom, and personal liberty.
                        </li>

                    <p><strong>Curative petition:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The concept of Curative petition was evolved by the Supreme Court of India in the matter of
                            <strong>Rupa Ashok Hurra vs. Ashok Hurra and Anr. (2002)</strong> where the question was
                            whether an aggrieved person is entitled to any relief against the final judgement/order of
                            the Supreme Court, after dismissal of a <strong>review petition</strong>.
                        </li>
                        <li>The Supreme Court in the said case held that in order to prevent abuse of its process and to
                            cure gross miscarriage of justice, it may reconsider its judgements in exercise of its
                            inherent powers.
                        </li>
                        <li>For this purpose the Court has devised what has been termed as a “curative” petition. In the
                            Curative petition, the petitioner is required to aver specifically that the grounds
                            mentioned therein had been taken in the review petition filed earlier and that it was
                            dismissed by circulation. This has to be certified by a senior advocate. The Curative
                            petition is then circulated to the three senior most judges and the judges who delivered the
                            impugned judgement, if available. No time limit is given for filing Curative petition.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
                    <p>To entertain the curative petitions, the court has laid down certain specific condition:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The petitioner will have to establish that there was a genuine violation of principles of
                            natural justice and fear of the bias of the judge and judgement that adversely affected him.
                        </li>
                        <li>The petition shall state specifically that the grounds mentioned had been taken in the
                            review petition and that it was dismissed by circulation.
                        </li>
                        <li>The curative petition must accompany certification by a senior lawyer relating to the
                            fulfillment of the above requirements.
                        </li>
                        <li>The petition is to be sent to the three senior most judges and judges of the bench who
                            passed the judgement affecting the petition, if available.
                        </li>
                        <li>If the majority of the judges on the above bench agree that the matter needs hearing, then
                            it would be sent to the same bench (as far as possible).
                        </li>
                        <li>The court could impose “exemplary costs” to the petitioner if his plea lacks merit.</li>

                    <p><strong>Financial structure: </strong>Currently, there are two components that make up the

                        <strong>Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA)</strong>. Both of these components were signed into
                        treaty in 2014 and became active in 2015.</p>
                    <p><strong>a) New Development Bank:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The New Development Bank (NDB) is based in Shanghai.</li>
                        <li>The New Development Bank (NDB), formerly referred to as the BRICS Development Bank, is a
                            <strong>multilateral development bank</strong> operated by the BRICS states.
                        </li>
                        <li>The bank’s primary focus of lending will be <strong>infrastructure projects</strong> with
                            authorized lending of up to $34 billion annually.
                        </li>
                        <li>South Africa will be the African Headquarters of the Bank named the “New Development Bank
                            Africa Regional Centre”.
                        </li>
                        <li>The bank will have starting capital of $50 billion, with capital increased to $100 billion
                            over time.

                        <li>Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa will initially contribute $10 billion each to
                            bring the total to $50 billion.

                    <p><strong>b) BRICS CRA:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The BRICS <strong>Contingent Reserve Arrangement</strong> (CRA) is a framework for providing
                            protection against <strong>global liquidity pressures</strong>.
                        </li>
                        <li>This includes currency issues where members’ national currencies are being adversely
                            affected by global financial pressures.
                        </li>
                        <li>It is found that emerging economies that experienced rapid economic liberalization went
                            through increased economic volatility, bringing uncertain macroeconomic environment.
                        </li>
                        <li>The CRA is generally seen as a competitor to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and along
                            with the New Development Bank is viewed as an example of increasing South-South cooperation.
                        </li>
                        <li>It was established in 2015 by the BRICS countries Brazil, Russia, India, China and South

                <li>A 1,300-km undersea pipeline from Iran, avoiding Pakistani waters, can bring natural gas from the
                    Persian Gulf to India at rates less than the price of LNG available in the spot market.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Cheaper fuel:</strong> Natural gas imported through the more than $4-billion pipeline would
                    cost $5-5.50 per million British thermal unit at the Indian coast, cheaper than the rate at which
                    some of the domestic fields supply gas.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Cheaper than the ones which are shipped: </strong>Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, imported
                    through ships costs about $7.50 per million British thermal unit.
                </li>
                <li>The cost of landed gas through an undersea pipeline will be at least $2 cheaper than importing LNG,
                    saving about $1 billion annually.
                </li>
                <li>The pipeline is planned to carry 31.5 million standard cubic meters gas per day. The pipeline can
                    first travel to <strong>Oman</strong>, and then onwards to Porbandar in the state of
                    <strong>Gujarat</strong>.

                        </li>
                        <li>New Delhi has not been participating in talks on the 1,036-km Iran-Pakistan-India gas
                            pipeline since 2007 citing security and commercial concerns. But, it has never officially
                            pulled out of the $7.6 billion project.

                            certain large and highly interconnected financial institutions hampered the orderly
                            functioning of the financial system, which in turn, negatively impacted the real economy.

                <p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Larsen C is the most northern major ice shelf in Antarctica. An iceberg expected to be one of
                        the 10 largest ever recorded is ready to break away from this ice shelf in Antarctica,
                        scientists say.
                    </li>
                    <li>Researchers have been tracking the rift in Larsen C for many years, watching it with some
                        trepidation after the collapse of Larsen A ice shelf in 1995 and the sudden break-up of the
                        Larsen B shelf in 2002.
                    </li>
                    <li>Last year, researchers reported that the Larsen C rift was growing fast. But in December the
                        speed of the rift went into overdrive, growing by a further 18km in just a couple of weeks. What
                        will become a massive iceberg (5000 sq.km) now hangs on to the shelf by a thread just 20km long.
                    </li>
                    <li>The researchers say that this is a geographical and not a climate event. The rift has been
                        present for decades, they say, but it has punched through at this particular time.
                    </li>
                    <li>It is believed that climate warming has brought forward the likely separation of the iceberg but
                        the scientists say they have no direct evidence to support this incidence.

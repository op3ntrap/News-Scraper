        <div id="Union">
            <p>The central government will approve and aid metro rail projects only if they have private participation
                and ensure last-mile connectivity for users, under a new policy cleared by the Union cabinet on
                Wednesday.</p>
            <p><strong>New metro rail policy</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>States will get powers to make rules and regulations and set up permanent fare fixation
                    authorities.
                </li>
                <li>In line with global best practices, metro projects will be approved on the basis of ‘Economic
                    Internal Rate of Return of 14%’, a change from the existing ‘Financial Internal Rate of Return of
                    8%’.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Funding to the Metro Projects</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Metro rail projects are capital-intensive and are generally financed by central and state
                    governments with equity and grants. The rest is raised from multilateral agencies like Japan
                    International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and European Investment Bank (EIB).
                </li>
                <li>Under the new policy, states need to adopt innovative mechanisms like value capture financing tools
                    to mobilize resources for financing metro projects by capturing a share of increase in the asset
                    values through ‘Betterment Levy’.
                </li>
                <li>States will also be required to enable low-cost debt capital by issuing corporate bonds for metro
                    projects.

            <ul>
                <li>A foreign court does not have the jurisdiction to decide matrimonial matters of a couple who have
                    Indian domicile and are governed under the Hindu Marriage Act even if the parties were at the time
                    residing in a foreign nation, the Bombay High Court has observed.
                </li>
                <li>The High Court was hearing an appeal filed by the man’s wife challenging an order passed by a family
                    court here that dismissed her plea seeking maintenance for herself and her two children. The family
                    court, while dismissing her plea, observed that the Dubai court had already adjudicated the matter.
                    However, the High Court, after perusing the case, opined that both are Indian citizens and there was
                    no material to endorse the husband’s claim that they have domiciles in Dubai.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Rulings of the court</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Under the circumstances, we are unable to hold that the Dubai court was a court of competent
                    jurisdiction to decide the matrimonial dispute between the petitioner [wife] and the respondent
                    [husband].
                </li>
                <li>The HC noted that the parties in the present case are Indian nationals, are Hindus by birth, were
                    married as per Hindu Vedic Rights and were governed in the matter of marriage and divorce by the
                    provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act 1955.

                <li>The Centre will, during the India-U.S. Trade Policy Forum (TPF) meeting likely in October, raise
                    Indian industry’s concerns over the U.S. visa ‘curbs’ and the ‘delay’ in inking a bilateral social
                    security pact (or totalisation agreement).

                <li>In the TPF meeting, the premier forum to resolve bilateral trade and investment issues, the U.S. is

            <p><strong>Facts</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The PDS in Tamil Nadu is intact and continues to retain the feature of universal coverage even after
                    implementation of the National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA).
                </li>
                <li>Although the guidelines under the NFSA prescribe identification of priority households, there is no
                    denial of any benefit under the PDS.
                </li>
                <li>There is no reduction even in the total coverage from the earlier Targeted Public Distribution
                    System, which was effective till Tamil Nadu joined the NFSA in November 2016.
                </li>
                <li>The major part of the subsidy for the distribution of foodgrains (90.81% for rice and 91.70% for
                    wheat) is borne by the Government of India.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Ensuring trade transparency</strong></p>
            <p><strong>About Indian government stand at the WTO on the Trade Facilitation Agreement</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Trade Facilitation Agreement was agreed on in 2013 in Bali and came into force from February
                    2017 after two-thirds of the WTO’s 164 members ratified it.
                </li>
                <li>Several trade-related issues such as transparency, predictability and efficiency at the ports,
                    faster clearance procedures, and improved appeal rights for traders are to be addressed by
                    countries.
                </li>
                <li>They shall notify various provisions to bring in the facilitation, over three years or more.</li>
                <li>Only the basic set of provisions will be implemented within one year.</li>
                <li>The Trade Facilitation Agreement allows for consultations before any new trade rules are notified. A
                    WTO study indicated that when the Trade Facilitation Agreement is fully implemented, trade costs for
                    member countries will decrease by an average of 14.3%. It is also estimated that the time taken to
                    export and import will come down drastically.
                </li>
                <li>Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has made budgetary allocations for bringing in single-window clearance
                    and improving customs clearance at the ports. A high-level committee chaired by the Cabinet
                    Secretary will monitor logistics and efficiency at ports and related issues.
                </li>
                <li>Thus, it can be seen that the Trade Facilitation Agreement is not about market access but inter alia
                    about facilitating and bringing trade transparency. By ratifying the Trade Facilitation Agreement,
                    India has not forgotten the developmental agenda lying unfulfilled at the WTO.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Protecting the farmer</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Public Stock Holding issue remains unresolved at the WTO.</li>
                <li>Although agreed on in Bali in 2013 and reiterated in Nairobi in 2015, that a permanent solution for
                    Public Stock Holding be found by 2017, it is still a ‘work-in-progress’.
                </li>
                <li>The existing WTO rules would have allowed a legal challenge to our Public Stock Holding and minimum
                    support price-based procurement programme in case we breached ‘the limit’ on procurement.
                </li>
                <li>The limit’ is defined as 10% of the value of production of the particular grain being procured.</li>
                <li>WTO rules classify procurement and holding of public stocks for food security purposes as ‘Green
                    Box’ or non trade-distorting.
                </li>
                <li>However, if foodgrains for the public stocks are procured through an administered price/minimum
                    support price and if this minimum support price is higher than the archaic fixed reference price
                    (calculated on base period 1986-88), then it is considered as trade-distorting agriculture support.
                </li>
                <li>Such trade-distorting support should be within ‘the limit’, which is 10% of the value of production
                    of the particular grain being procured.
                </li>
                <li>One of the first things that this government did in 2014 was to intensely engage with the WTO to
                    obtain a ‘peace clause’ so that even if we did breach ‘the limit’, no one shall challenge our
                    programme till such a time a permanent solution is found, agreed on, and adopted by the WTO
                    membership.
                </li>
                <li>Providing food to the poor or targeted groups at subsidised prices is fully WTO-compatible. This
                    does not figure at all in the WTO calculations. India has not undertaken any commitment in the WTO
                    for any kind of limit on the food supplied under the NFSA.

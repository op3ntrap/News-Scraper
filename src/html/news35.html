                <li>A long forgotten slice of martial history related to Mysuru will be revisited when Prime Minister
                    Narendra Modi pays tribute to fallen Indian soldiers at the Haifa cemetery in Israel.

            <p><strong>The Mysore Imperial Service and the liberation of Haifa:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Mysore Imperial Service played a big role in the liberation of Haifa on September 23, 1918, from
                    Ottoman Turks and Germans, by allied forces.
                </li>
                <li>This is seen as one of the <strong>fiercest battles</strong> in the west Asian theatre of World War
                    I in which India, as a British colony, fought German and the Ottoman troops.
                </li>
                <li>The Mysore Lancers were in the 15th Imperial Service as the forces sent by the princely states of
                    Mysore, Jodhpur and Hyderabad.
                </li>
                <li>The then Mysuru Maharaja Nalwudi Krishnaraja Wadiyar sent his troops to defend the empire and even
                    gave nearly ₹50 lakh to the India War Fund.

            <ul>
                <li><strong>December 15, 2016</strong> <strong>Supreme Court order: </strong>prohibited the sale of
                    liquor within a distance of 500 metres from the outer edge of national and State highways.
                </li>
                <li><strong>March 2017 order:</strong> the ban was not restricted to just liquor shops alongside the
                    highways but also to other larger establishments, including pubs and hotels.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Intention:</strong> to prevent drunken driving on high-speed thoroughfares.</li>
                <li>Many states started de-notifying highways in order to circumvent the December 15<sup>th</sup></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Petition:</strong> filed by NGO Arrive Safe Society challenging the Chandigarh administration’s
                move to de-notify certain roads.</p>
            <p><strong>In news:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>The Supreme Court observations</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>nothing wrong in de-notifying particular stretches of highways running inside city limits as city
                    roads and such de-classification does not violate its earlier order of banning liquor sales near
                    National and State highways.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Reasons given:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Traffic inside city limits is usually slow and heavy, and stretches de-notified fall within the city
                    limits.
                </li>
                <li>.The goal of the liquor ban was to prevent drunken driving in fast-moving traffic.</li>
                <li>The pace of traffic with the city is very different from traffic outside city limits.</li>
                <li>Purpose of the ban is to avoid drivers getting inebriated while driving on highways inter-linking
                    cities.
                </li>

                <li>As per the inputs from a senior Home Ministry official: The Centre is considering <strong>partial
                    removal</strong> of <strong>the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA)</strong> from <strong>Assam
                    and Arunachal Pradesh</strong>. There was no proposal to withdraw it in Jammu and Kashmir.
                </li>
                <li>In Arunachal Pradesh, complete withdrawal, except two districts in the east bordering Myanmar and
                    Nagaland.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Views sought:</strong> The Ministry has asked the two States for their views on AFSPA
                    withdrawal and said that it was open to reviewing the stringent law in other States like Manipur.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Basics of AFSPA :</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Armed Forces (Special Powers) Acts (AFSPA), are Acts of the Parliament of India that grant special
                    powers to the Indian Armed Forces in what each act terms “disturbed areas”.According to The
                    Disturbed Areas (Special Courts) Act, 1976 once declared ‘disturbed’, the area has to maintain
                    status quo for a minimum of 3 months.
                </li>
                <li>The AFSPA gives powers to the Army and Central forces deployed in “disturbed areas” to kill anyone
                    acting in contravention of law, arrest and search any premises without a warrant.
                </li>
                <li>It provides cover to forces from prosecution and legal suits without the Centre’s sanction.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Active AFSPA:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Whole of Nagaland, Assam, Manipur (excluding the seven Assembly constituencies of Imphal).</li>
                <li>In Arunachal Pradesh, it is in force in 16 police stations and in Tirap, Longding and Changlang
                    districts bordering Assam.
                </li>
                <li>Tripura withdrew AFSPA in 2015.</li>
                <li>It is not in force in Meghalaya (except 20 kilometre area along Assam border) and Mizoram.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Supreme court ruling:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>On July 8, 2016, in a landmark ruling, The Supreme Court of India ended the immunity of the armed
                    forces from prosecution under AFSPA, saying,“It does not matter whether the victim was a common
                    person or a militant or a terrorist, nor does it matter whether the aggressor was a common person or
                    the state. The law is the same for both and is equally applicable to both… This is the requirement
                    of a democracy and the requirement of preservation of the rule of law and the preservation of
                    individual liberties.”
                </li>
                <li>Supreme Court said that any encounter carried out by armed forces in the garb of AFSPA should be
                    subjected to thorough inquiry.

            <p><strong>In news:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Law Commission of India- the commission headed by former Supreme Court judge Justice B.S.
                    Chauhan, has recommended compulsory registration of marriages.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>To protect gullible women who become victims of fake marriages.</li>
                <li>The lack of provisions for compulsory registration of marriages had proven disastrous for women and
                    deprived them of societal recognition and legal security.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key fact:</strong> Fraudulent marriages are on the rise especially among non-resident Indians.
                Compulsory registration can serve as a means to ensure that conditions of a valid marriage have been
                performed.</p>
            <p><strong>Minor amendment:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Minor amendment to the <strong>Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969</strong>, including a
                    provision for compulsory registration of marriage, would serve the purpose.
                </li>
                <li>And there was no need to amend any of the personal laws of religious communities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>2006 Supreme Court in Seema vs Ashwani case:</strong></p>
            <ul>

                </li>
                <li><strong>Key Fact</strong>: 20-25% increase in transgressions by the Chinese PLA till May this year,
                    particularly in Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh. On an average around 300 transgressions are reported
                    along the China border due to “difference in perception.

                <li>These patrols are undertaken at eight of the key disputed locations, mostly in Ladakh and Arunachal

            <p><strong>Reasons for increased transgression:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>FIND initially started a unique initiative for diagnosing paediatric TB in four cities of Delhi,

                        non-profit based in Geneva, Switzerland. FIND functions as a product development partnership,
                        engaging in active collaboration with over 150 partners to facilitate the development,
                        evaluation, and implementation of diagnostic tests for poverty-related diseases. The
                        organisation’s Geneva headquarters are in Campus Biotech. Country offices are located in New
                        Delhi, India; Cape Town, South Africa; and Hanoi, Viet Nam.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Priorities:</strong> The organization focuses on improving diagnosis in several disease
                        areas, including hepatitis C, HIV, malaria, neglected tropical diseases (sleeping sickness,
                        Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, buruli ulcer), and tuberculosis. Alongside this, FIND works on
                        diagnostic connectivity, antimicrobial resistance, acute febrile illness, and outbreak
                        preparedness.

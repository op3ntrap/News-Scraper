            <p><strong>March 10, 2014 order: </strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Supreme Court, had ordered the government to conclude <strong>criminal trials</strong> in which
                    <strong>charges have been framed</strong> against sitting MPs and MLAs <strong>“speedily and
                        expeditiously” within a year</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>The apex court had ordered the trials to be held on a <strong>day-to-day</strong></li>
                <li>Only <strong>“extraordinary circumstances”</strong> would justify a trial exceeding the one-year
                    deadline.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Supreme Court’s current directives: </strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It wanted the government to report back by December 13 on how many of these 1,581 cases were finally
                    decided and how many ended in acquittals and convictions for MPs and MLAs.
                </li>
                <li>The court further directed the Centre to place on record how many cases have been filed against
                    sitting and former legislators between 2014 till date.
                </li>
                <li>The apex court said it wanted details of the status of each such case and how the criminal trials
                    ended in every one of them.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Additional Solicitor General response:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Centre was not averse to the setting up of special courts to exclusively try political
                    persons.
                </li>
                <li>There was no room for a second opinion that corruption and criminality should be wiped out of
                    politics.
                </li>
                <li>The government would support any move for the “<strong>utmost expeditious disposal”</strong> of
                    criminal cases involving political persons.

                <li>The Election Commission (EC) took a definitive stand in the Supreme Court that <strong>convicted
                    persons should be banned from contesting elections for life.</strong></li>
                <li>EC is of the opinion that such a move would be a firm step against criminalisation of politics and
                    uniform ban would be in the spirit of the fundamental rights of the Constitution, including the
                    right to equality.
                </li>
                <li>As of now, a person, on conviction, is debarred from contesting any elections for the period of his
                    or her prison sentence and six years thereafter.

                <li>An analysis by the <strong>Association of Democratic Reforms</strong> and National Election Watch
                    has revealed that <strong>61 of the 338 candidates</strong> in the Himachal Pradesh Assembly
                    elections have criminal records against them.

                <li>The Himachal Pradesh Election Watch and ADR have analysed the affidavits of 60 MLAs re-contesting in
                    this election. Their average assets in 2012 were worth ₹23 crore, while this year their average
                    assets are worth ₹9.44 crore, which is an average increase of 80% in five years.
                </li>
                <li>Of the total candidates, 120 have declared their educational qualification to be between Classes V
                    and XII pass, while 214 are graduates or above.

            <ul>
                <li>The draft regulations, which will be finalised by December 31 this year, envisage a <strong>virtually
                    unregulated flight</strong> at heights up to 50 feet for nano drones that weigh 250 grams or lower.

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Research project: </strong>researchers from the Newcastle University in the United Kingdom
                    and the Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi sampled water and sediments at seven sites along the
                    Ganga in different seasons.

                    <ul>
                        <li>The levels of resistance genes that lead to “<strong>superbugs</strong>” were found to be
                            about 60 times greater during the pilgrimage months of May and June than at other times of
                            the year.
                        </li>
                        <li>The researchers had then said preventing the spread of resistance-genes that promote
                            life-threatening bacteria could be achieved by improving waste management at key pilgrimage
                            sites.
                        </li>
                        <li>India has some of the highest antibiotic resistance rates among bacteria that commonly cause
                            infections in the community and healthcare facilities.
                        </li>
                        <li>Resistance to the broad-spectrum antibiotics fluoroquinolones and third generation
                            cephalosporin was more than 70% in Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella
                            pneumoniae, and more than 50% in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
                        </li>
                        <li>Other than ‘cultural factors’ such as bathing in the Ganga, the drivers of AMR included
                            excessive use of antibiotics in the livestock industry and unchecked discharge of effluents
                            by the pharmaceutical industry.

                </li>
                <li><strong>Key Fact:</strong> In 2014, India was the highest consumer of antibiotics, followed by China
                    and the United States. However, the per-capita consumption of antibiotics in India was much lower
                    than in several other high-income countries.

            <p><strong>What needs to be done?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Too little work had been done so far to understand the cause and nature of AMR.</li>
                <li>AMR research studies in India were of limited scope in all areas.<strong> </strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Basic Information:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR)</strong> is the ability of a microorganism (like bacteria,
                    viruses, and some parasites) to stop an antimicrobial (such as antibiotics, antivirals and
                    antimalarials) from working against it. As a result, standard treatments become ineffective,
                    infections persist and may spread to others.

        <ul>
            <li>Carnivorous plants have been known to employ a variety of techniques like <strong>nectar, smell, colour
                and ultraviolet florescence</strong> to lure and capture prey.
            </li>
            <li><strong>New findings:</strong> scientists at the <strong>Jawaharlal Nehru Tropical Botanic
                Gardens</strong> and <strong>Research Institute</strong> here have come up with evidence that <strong>some
                carnivorous plants use carbon dioxide (CO2) to attract insects and ants to their prey traps.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>Indian pitcher plant (Nepenthes khasiana) uses the gas, both to attract prey and to aid the digestive
                process.
            </li>
            <li>The unopened pitchers of the plant are carbon dioxide-enriched, with a gas concentration of 2,500 to
                5,000 ppm (parts per million), approximately 10 times that in the earth’s atmosphere.
            </li>
            <li>The open Nepenthes pitchers were found to emit CO2 constantly to attract insects</li>
            <li>The high CO2 environment in the pitchers and the dissolved CO2 in the pitcher fluids might also act as a
                tranquilliser for the trapped prey.

        <div id="UN says carbon emissions gap could affect climate target">
            <p><strong>Highlights of the UN Environment Emissions Gap Report 2017:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Report warns that a <strong>big carbon emissions gap</strong> exists between the levels that can be
                    achieved in 2030 with present climate commitments, and what needs to be done using set pathways to
                    limit increases in global average temperature to less than 2° Celsius or a more ambitious 1.5° C by
                    the year 2100.
                </li>
                <li>Full implementation of the unconditional <strong>Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)</strong>
                    and comparable action afterwards “could result in a temperature increase of about 3.2° C by 2100
                    relative to pre-industrial levels”, while full implementation of conditional NDCs would marginally
                    lower that projection by about 0.2°C.
                </li>
                <li>The breaching of the safe limits that is possible even with current climate commitments — the NDCs
                    that form the core of the <strong>Paris Agreement</strong> — indicates that governments will need to
                    deliver much stronger pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions when they are revised in 2020.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Fossil fuels and cement production account for about 70% of greenhouse gases.</strong></li>
                <li>The Paris accord pledges only a third of what is needed to avoid climate catastrophe, and adopting
                    new technologies in key sectors, at investments of under $100 per tonne of emissions, could cut them
                    by up to 36 gigatonnes per year by 2030, which is more than sufficient to bridge the current gap.
                </li>
                <li>A large part of the potential to close the emissions gap lies in solar and wind energy, efficient
                    appliances and passenger cars, afforestation and stopping deforestation.
                </li>
                <li>Strong action on plugging other greenhouse gases, such as hydrofluorocarbons, through the <strong>Kigali
                    Amendment to the Montreal Protocol</strong>, and other short-lived climate pollutants such as black
                    carbon, could contribute.
                </li>
                <li>CO2 emissions have remained stable since 2014, driven in part by renewable energy, notably in China
                    and India.
                </li>
                <li>The report warns that other greenhouse gases, such as methane, are still rising, and a global growth
                    spurt could send CO2 emissions upward.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Basic Information:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>The Montreal Protocol</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Montreal Protocol </strong>on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (a protocol to the
                    Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer) is an international treaty designed to
                    protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production of numerous substances that are responsible
                    for ozone depletion
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Kigali Amendment</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>In the 28th meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol, negotiators from 197 nations have
                    signed a historic agreement to amend the Montreal Protocol in Kigali, a capital city of a tiny
                    African country, Rwanda on 15th October 2016.
                </li>
                <li>As per the agreement, these countries are expected to reduce the manufacture and use of
                    Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by roughly 80-85% from their respective baselines, till 2045.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Kigali Agreement: Important Points</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is a legally binding agreement between the signatory parties with non-compliance measures.</li>
                <li>It will come into effect from 1st January 2019 provided it is ratified by at least 20 member parties
                    by then.
                </li>
                <li>It has shown a considerable flexibility in approach while setting phase-down targets for different
                    economies accommodating their developmental aspirations, different socio-economic compulsions, and
                    scientific &amp; technological capabilities.
                </li>
                <li>It has divided the signatory parties into three groups-
                    <ol>
                        <li>The first group consists of rich and developed economies like USA, UK and EU countries who
                            will start to phase down HFCs by 2019 and reduce it to 15% of 2012 levels by 2036.
                        </li>
                        <li>The second group consists of emerging economies like China, Brazil as well as some African
                            countries who will start phase down by 2024 and reduce it to 20% of 2021 levels by 2045.
                        </li>
                        <li>The third group consists of developing economies and some of the hottest climatic countries
                            like India, Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia who will start phasing down HFCs by 2028 and reduce
                            it to 15% of 2024-2026 levels till 2047.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>It also has a provision for a multilateral fund for developing countries for adaptation and
                    mitigation.
                </li>
                <li>The Technology and Energy Assessment Panel (TEAP) will take a periodic review of the alternative
                    technologies and products for their energy efficiency and safety standards.
                </li>
                <li>This phase down is expected to arrest the global average temperature rise up to 0.5o C by 2100.</li>
                <li>Kigali agreement is an amendment to Montreal Protocol.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>First <strong>Goa Maritime Conclave</strong>(GMC) of Navy Chiefs of Indian Ocean littoral states
                    hosted by the Indian Navy at the Naval War College in Goa.
                </li>
                <li>The GMC is intended to be held every year and aims to “bring together like-minded countries to
                    evolve collective responses to challenges in the maritime domain.”
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Concerns raised by Defence Minister during the conclave:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Expressed concern at the <strong>increased militarisation</strong> in the Indian Ocean and the
                    <strong>extra-regional nations</strong> setting up a “<strong>near permanant presence</strong>” in
                    the region, in an apparent reference to the expanding Chinese presence in the region.
                </li>
                <li>Extra-regional nations are creating naval outposts as well as <strong>dual-use
                    infrastructure</strong> in the region.
                </li>
                <li>There is an “incremental yet steady” increase in numbers of warships operating in the region. This
                    militarisation “increases the complexities for the countries of this region.”
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Maritime challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>China has set up or acquired stakes in a series of infrastructure facilities in the region
                    and has recently opened its first overseas military base at Djibouti in the Horn of Africa.</strong>
                </li>
                <li>The Chinese Navy has also maintained a steady presence of warships and submarines in the Indian
                    Ocean under the garb of anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden.
                </li>
                <li>To counter this, the Indian Navy has now put in place a <strong>new concept of ‘mission based
                    deployment’ </strong>to maintain round the clock surveillance on India’s vital areas of interest
                    across the length and breadth of the <strong>Indian Ocean Region</strong> (IOR).

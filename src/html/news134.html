                <li><strong>The Hadiya case:</strong> involving the alleged conversion of a Hindu woman to Islam and her
                    marriage to a Muslim man

            <ul>
                <li>Centre’s <strong>National Investigation Agency (NIA)</strong> claims in the Supreme Court that the
                    <strong>Hadiya case</strong>, involving the alleged conversion of a Hindu woman to Islam and her
                    marriage to a Muslim man, is part of a ‘<strong>pattern’ of religious conversions and radicalisation
                        in the southern State.</strong></li>
                <li>The Pinarayi Vijayan government in Kerala rejected the claims made by the NIA.</li>
                <li>In an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court, the Kerala government said the investigation conducted
                    by the State police had not revealed any offences which warranted an NIA probe.
                </li>
                <li>The State also questioned the sudden transfer of the case to the NIA. saying the State Police Chief
                    had already entrusted the investigation to the Additional Director General of Police (Crimes) and
                    directed to constitute a Special Investigation Team.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Supreme Court’s present stand</strong>: “We will hear logical and legal arguments on two
                    issues —can the HC nullify a marriage exercising jurisdiction under Article 226 and was an NIA probe
                    necessary,”

            <p><strong>In news:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Supreme Court has ruled that insurance claims cannot be denied to a person merely on the grounds
                    of delay in filing the claim, holding that “mechanical” denials on technical bases will cause people
                    to lose confidence in the industry.
                </li>
                <li>The Supreme Court set aside the verdicts of various consumer courts, including the National Consumer
                    Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC), which had ruled that insurance companies could deny the
                    benefit of cover for delay in filing the claims.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Judgment:</strong> “It is true that the owner has to intimate the insurer immediately after
                    the theft of the vehicle. However, this condition should not bar settlement of genuine claims,
                    particularly when the delay in intimation or submission of documents is due to unavoidable
                    circumstances. The decision of the insurer to reject the claim has to be based on valid grounds.
                    Rejection of the claims on purely technical grounds in a mechanical manner will result in loss of
                    confidence of policyholders in the insurance industry,”.
                </li>
                <li>The verdict would bring big relief to people who fail to file insurance claims immediately after
                    their vehicles are damaged in accidents or stolen.

        <div id="Draft policy for abolishing Haj subsidy">
            <p><strong>In news:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Key highlights of a proposed Haj policy drafted by a committee appointed by the Centre:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Abolishing subsidy for Haj pilgrims and</li>
                <li>Allow muslim women devotees above 45 to travel in a group of at least four without a male.</li>
                <li>Women below 45, however, will have to be accompanied by male Mehrams, according to the policy.</li>
                <li>It also proposes to increase the quota for Mehrams from 200 to 500.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The proposed Haj Policy 2018-22, by a panel headed by former secretary Afzal Amanullah, also
                    recommends bringing down the number of embarkation points (EPs) from which pilgrims can take flights
                    to Saudi Arabia from the present 21 to nine.
                </li>
                <li>The policy has been drafted in light of a 2012 Supreme Court order asking the Centre to abolish the
                    subsidy gradually by 2022
                </li>
                <li>India has an annual Haj quota of 1.7 lakh devotees</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Practice at present:</strong> Till now, women devotees could not travel without a male Mehram.
                The term Mehram refers to a male a woman cannot marry at anytime in her life (i.e. father, brother or
                son, etc). The cut in funds meant for subsidy will be used for educational empowerment and welfare of
                Muslims.</p>

                </li>
                <li>Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin said he expects India to “definitely” play a role in the
                    peacekeeping mission which will soon come up for discussion at the <strong>UN Security Council
                        (UNSC).</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>India’s role in peacekeeping commended</li>
                <li>Klimkin, is on a three-day visit to India, held extensive discussions with his counterpart, Sushma
                    Swaraj, for the <strong>upcoming inter-governmental commission dialogue between two sides.</strong>
                </li>
                <li>Klimkin said discussion on India’s participation in the peacekeeping mission was at a preliminary
                    level and further consultations were needed to fine-tune the composition of the mission.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>In news:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The recent tension between India and China has prompted the government here to think of measures to
                    reduce its dependence on China for pharmaceutical products.
                </li>
                <li>The health ministry along with drug regulators is planning to take a series of measures to limit
                    reliance on China as well as tighten the regulatory checks and balances to ensure only <strong>good
                        quality supplies</strong> are entering the Indian market.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Currently, India gets 70-80% of its medicines and medical devices supplies, including raw material
                    for pharmaceuticals (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient) from China. <strong>This poses a major risk
                        of severe drug shortage if India’s diplomatic relations with China worsen.</strong></li>
                <li>The landed price of API from China in India is 15-20% less than its production cost here, making it
                    more viable for companies to import.
                </li>
                <li><strong>In fact, in 2014, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval had also warned the government about
                    India’s over-dependence on China for API and how tension between the two countries can cause a
                    crisis in the public health system of India.</strong></li>
                <li>Following Doval’s alert, the government had formed a committee of experts to formulate a specific
                    policy to boost API manufacturing in India.
                </li>
                <li>India was once a favoured destination for sourcing low-cost, good quality raw material for
                    manufacturing medicines. Gradually, China has taken over this bulk drug market globally in the past
                    few years by creating huge capacities.

                <p>Kovalam has three beaches separated by rocky outcroppings in its 17 km coastline, the three together
                    form the famous crescent of the Kovalam beach.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lighthouse Beach: </strong>The southernmost beach, the Lighthouse Beach is the one most
                        frequented by tourists, Lighthouse Beach got its name due to the old Vizhinjam Lighthouse
                        located on a 35 meter high on top of the <strong>Kurumkal hillock</strong>.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Hawah Beach: </strong>Eve’s Beach, more commonly known as Hawa Beach, ranks second, in
                        the early day, is a beehive of activities with fishermen setting out for sea. With a high rock
                        promontory and a calm bay of blue waters, this beach paradise creates a unique aquarelle on
                        moonlit nights.

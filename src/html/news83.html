                        <li>The verdict was delivered by a 3:2 majority.</li>
                        <li>All the five judges agreed on the broad issue of the <strong>undesirability of instant
                            talaq, or divorce </strong>pronounced in <strong>one sitting </strong>simply by uttering
                            talaq thrice.

                <li><strong>Main Observations:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In view of the different opinions recorded, by a majority of 3:2, the practice of <strong>‘talaq-e-biddat’</strong>
                            — triple talaq — is set aside.
                        </li>
                        <li>Triple talaq was part of Islamic religious practice for 1,400 years and hence got the
                            protection of the Constitution under <strong>Article 25</strong>. But at the same time,
                            since most Islamic countries, including Pakistan and Bangladesh, had abolished triple talaq,
                            it was time the <strong>legislature brought a bill</strong> to correct the anomaly in
                            personal law.

            <p><strong>CONTEXT:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Supreme Court Verdict set the practice of triple talaq as ‘<strong>manifestly arbitrary’</strong>.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Observations:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Court said that triple talaq is not in the Quran. But the Sharia is not what the entire Quran
                    is. It is a mixture of Quran, Hadees and Ijma. This is where they have faulted.
                </li>
                <li>Chief Justice of India J.S. Khehar used the Supreme Court’s rare and extraordinary jurisdiction
                    under <strong>Article 142</strong> to injunct Muslim husbands from divorcing their wives for the
                    next six months through the same instant talaq.
                </li>
                <li>Supreme Court issued the direction after observing that even theocratic Islamic States had corrected
                    their Shariat to banish instant talaq.
                </li>
                <li>Supreme Court ordered the government to frame a ruling to address the issue of Muslim women under
                    the yoke of triple talaq.
                </li>
                <li>Verdict compared triple talaq to social evils such as sati, infanticide and devadasi system, which
                    were cast out by way of legislation and not by judicial orders.
                </li>
                <li>However, the direction under <strong>Article 142 </strong>in the minority verdict failed to come
                    alive as the majority of the judges on the Bench set aside instant talaq with immediate effect. This
                    is the clear mandate of <strong>Article 14</strong> (equality before law) of the Constitution. India
                    is also committed to eradicate discrimination on the ground of sex.

                    reservoirs on Nepal’s rivers — for flood control, navigation, urban use and irrigation in Bihar and
                    Uttar Pradesh.
                </li>
                <li>New Delhi made deep inroads into Nepal’s political class, but none did it use more than the
                    Madhesbaadi parties
                </li>
                <li>The Great Blockade, forced the Kathmandu to reach out to Beijing and sign a slew of trade, transit
                    and infrastructural agreements with it.
                </li>
                <li>Nepal is today better connected by air to Chinese cities than to India.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Matters pending:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Nepal and India have to concentrate on the numerous matters that need concentration and resolution
                </li>
                <li><strong>Open border</strong> -While it is Nepal’s Left that has traditionally demanded restrictions
                    on the border, the call now rises from the Indian security establishment.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Massive floods</strong> in Nepal plains have also affected downstream areas across the
                    border. A permanent bilateral mechanism is required to save the plains population of Nepal from
                    suffering
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The Kosi Barrage</strong> and attendant embankments have the possibility of wreaking
                            havoc because siltation of six decades has raised the riverbed within the levees far above
                            the outlying tracts
                        </li>
                        <li>The easy answer for the Indian politician is to demand a high dam in the hills of Nepal even
                            as alternatives are not studied, such as redistribution of waters into various older
                            channels of the Kosi in Bihar.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The rights of migrant Indian labour in Nepal and Nepali labour in India is a topic that rarely comes
                    up
                </li>
                <li>Border disputes pending between the two countries — at Susta, Kalapani and the ‘<strong>tri-junction’
                    of Lipulekh</strong></li>
                <li>Nepal has planned to sell electricity to India once it has a hydropower surplus.</li>
                <li>But Indian government directive that it will not allow import of electricity other than from power
                    companies with more than 51% Indian equity.
                </li>
                <li>Neglect by the Kathmandu intelligentsia, such as regarding the impact of demonetisation and the
                    application of Goods and Services Tax on Nepal’s economy and citizenry.
                </li>
                <li>The arbitrary blockages and go-slow at Indian Customs at border points, the selective use of
                    quarantine for the export of Nepali agricultural produce, the increasing high-handedness of the
                    Sashastra Seema Bal in dealing with Nepalis crossing over.

                <li>India has granted Pfizer Inc. a patent for its powerful <strong>pneumonia vaccine</strong> <strong>Prevenar
                    13</strong>.
                </li>

                            in poorer nations.
                        </li>
                        <li>The decision by India’s patent office bars other companies from making cheaper copies of the
                            vaccine and allows Pfizer to exclusively sell it in India until 2026.
                        </li>
                        <li>The patent grant means Indian companies won’t be able to make the vaccine for domestic use,
                            or exports.
                        </li>
                        <li>The decision also has international implications, as several poorer nations rely on India’s
                            robust drugs industry to supply cheaper copies of medicines and vaccines.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Pfizer’s vaccine protects children and adults from 13 types of pneumococcal bacteria, and a
                            full vaccination course costs about $170 on India’s private market.
                        </li>
                        <li>India started giving out the vaccine for free under its national immunisation program
                            earlier this year, but the rollout like that of most vaccines in the program, is in phases,
                            so only about 2.1 million of the 25 million eligible people in the country will get it this
                            year.

                <li>Indian scientists have discovered a new species of frog that has a snout-shaped nose, just like a
                    pig’s.
                </li>
                <li>The soiled-dwelling species, discovered by scientists from the Centre for Cellular and Molecular
                    Biology (CCMB) in Hyderabad, has been named after the Indian herpetologist <strong>
                        Bhupathy.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Location:</strong> Bhupathy’s purple frog inhabits the eastern slopes of the Western Ghats,
                    near the <strong>Srivilliputhur Grizzled Giant Squirrel Wildlife Sanctuary</strong> in <strong>Tamil
                        Nadu</strong>.

            <p><strong>Evidence in favor of continental drift theory :</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The discovery is significant as it constitutes additional evidence in favour of the theory of
                    continental drift.
                </li>
                <li>The Purple frog is an inhabitant of Seychelles, and the discovery of Bhupathy’s purple frog in India
                    suggests that the Indian subcontinent was part of the ancient landmass of <strong>Gondwana</strong>
                    before splitting from Seychelles 65 million years ago.

                <li>The first ever Gender Vulnerability Index is computed by Plan India, a non-governmental
                    organisation.
                </li>
                <li>It provides state-wise ranking by analyzing four parameters, namely health, education, poverty and
                    protection/safety from violence. 
                </li>
                <li>The index is topped by Goa followed by Kerala and Mizoram.</li>
                <li>Bihar ranked the lowest in the index particularly women safety and security.</li>
                <li>The composite index has been developed within research for the NGO’s “Plan for Every Child
                    campaign”.
                </li>
                <li>It is aimed at comprehensively understanding the dimensions of various problems affecting children,

        <div id="‘LG cannot"> <strong>Context</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The Supreme Court on Thursday reminded the Delhi government that there were limitations to its
                    powers under the Constitution, but added that in matters where the Lieutenant Governor (L-G) had
                    differences with it, he could not sit on files. 
                </li>
                <li>Instead, L-G was required to forward them to the President within a reasonable time.</li>
                <li>The court said in urgent matters, it is the L-G who is given primacy.</li>
                <li>The executive power of the government of Delhi was not exclusive to the executive power of the
                    Centre.
                </li>
                <li>SC was hearing the Delhi government’s plea challenging a Delhi High Court order confirming the L-G
                    as the administrative head of the National Capital Territory (NCT).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong> </strong><strong>The Plea by the State government</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Appearing for the state government, Senior Counsel contended that its day-to-day working was being
                    hindered as civil servants feel they don’t have to report to the ministers but only to the L-G and
                    the L-G feels he has inherent power to veto. 
                </li>
                <li>As a result, the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers is neutralized.</li>
                <li>And, even civil servants do not recognise the ministers as heads of departments. As a result no
                    decision can be taken.
                </li>
                <li>The Senior Counsel for the state also sought to know if this is contemplated under Article 239AA and
                    the provisions must be interpreted in a way that it serves the object.
                </li>
                <li>The counsel added that even the decisions on extending welfare measures were stuck because of the
                    L-G’s stance and this interfered with the government functioning and a constructive interpretation
                    will not defeat the purposes of 239AA.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong> </strong><strong>The SC viewpoint</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The SC wanted to know that in the absence of a law, who has the power the executive or the L-G and
                    added that the language of the Constitution says L-G’s decision is final. 
                </li>
                <li>The court was of the view that the public order in Delhi, police or land cannot be subject of
                    executive power of government of Delhi.
                </li>
                <li>The court also considered if some restrictions can be read into the proviso dealing with the powers
                    of the L-G or whether it can be restricted to some cases. 
                </li>
                <li>And added that even when there were differences between the L-G and state government, the L-G cannot
                    be sitting on a file. He is under Constitutional obligation to refer it to President, which means he
                    has to send that in a reasonable time. The L-G he must also record his differences in writing.
                </li>
                <li>The SC pointed out that under Article 239 (1), it was the President who appoints the administrator
                    for Delhi and this administrator was designated as L-G, which means the administration of Delhi is
                    by the President in the name of the administrator and that the substantive power to appoint the
                    administrator is under Article 239 (which deals with the administration of Union Territories and
                    President’s power in this regard) and not under Article 239AA.
                </li>
                <li>But the State’s counsel countered it by saying that though the genesis of appointment is in 239, the
                    measure is in 239AA and the objective of 239AA would not have been to create dual governments. 
                </li>
                <li>The SC said that the L-G was entitled to have his views and whatever power executive has it has to
                    flow from 239AA.
                </li>
                <li>Article 239AA(4) (which speaks about a Council of Ministers to aid and advise the L-G) may be a
                    recognition of Article 73, which says that the executive powers of the Union extends to all matters
                    in respect to which the Parliament can make law.
                </li>
                <li>The CJI added that when the Constitution-makers included these provisions in the document, they
                    probably had in mind the question of Constitutional collegiality.

        <p> </p>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Our unemployment rate of 4.9 per cent is not  vague but a wages problem(i.e. low wages)</li>
                <li>This diagnosis is importan</li>
                <li>As our real problem is wages, India needs the higher productivity that comes from structural change:
                    Formalisation, industrialisation, urbanisation, skilling and deep financial markets
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How demonetisation made India a better habitat for formal job creation? </strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Demonetisation has reduced cash with citizens.</li>
                <li>Bank deposits have increased by somewhere between Rs 2.8-4.3 lakh crore.</li>
                <li>Currently, banks are lending this liquidity to the RBI but when they start doing their jobs well,
                    this liquidity  will boost investment and formal job creation.
                </li>
                <li>Demonetisation exploded the number of digital payments on UPI/Bhim from 1 lakh in October 2016 to
                    7.7 crore in October 2017.
                </li>
                <li>Digitisation is important for formalisation because it makes regulatory arbitrage and tax evasion
                    difficult.
                </li>
                <li>Demonetisation has catalysed a savings shift away from gold and real estate.</li>
                <li>The eight months after demonetisation saw mutual fund inflows of Rs 1.69 lakh crore and the three
                    months after demonetisation saw Life Insurance Premiums rising by 46 per cent.
                </li>
                <li>Greater financialisation of savings creates a virtuous cycle for formal job creation because they
                    deepen and broaden domestic capital markets.
                </li>
                <li>Expensive loans are better than no loans but the cost of money has been crippling for India’s
                    entrepreneurs.
                </li>
                <li>Lowering interest rates is a policy priority and banks had been only passing on 50 per cent of lower
                    policy rates to customers; in the year after demonetisation this has risen to 100 per cent.
                </li>
                <li>India’s economic trajectory suggests interest rates could reduce another 3 per cent over time.</li>
                <li>sustained formal job creation needs the lower interest rates that come from macroeconomic stability,
                    fiscal discipline, muted inflation expectations and an Independent Monetary Policy Committee.
                </li>
                <li>Demonetisation targeted a less-cash society because cash is the primary tool of corruption</li>
                <li>Demonetisation did not end corruption but raised its costs</li>
                <li>And ending our sense of humour about the rule of law that bred a riskless view of cash is an
                    important pre-condition for sustained, formal, high-wage job creation
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong> </strong><strong>The way forward</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The problem for India’s youth is not jobs but wages.</li>
                <li>As India completes a year of demonetisation, it’s early for conclusions but the early results are
                    encouraging

            <ul>
                <li>Centre reconstitutes the Multi-Agency Group formed in 2016 to investigate disclosures on offshore
                    accounts of 714 Indians.

            </ul>
            <p><strong> </strong><strong>What are the ‘Paradise Papers’?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>These are around 13 million leaked files from offshore service providers and company registries
                    obtained by a German newspaper.
                </li>
                <li>It was made public by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and its media
                    partners.
                </li>
                <li>They essentially reveal the offshore interests and activities of politicians, world leaders and
                    celebrities, and the tax engineering of more than 100 MNCs, from around 180 countries.
                </li>
                <li>It also includes details of corporate registries maintained by governments in 19 secrecy
                    jurisdictions often referred to as “tax paradises”.
                </li>
                <li>Notably, a major portion of these files are in relation with a Bermuda firm Appleby and a
                    Singapore-based Asiaciti Trust.
                </li>
                <li>Unlike the previous leaks, the latest revelations are more about mega corporates than individual
                    players, on their misuse of offshore jurisdictions.
                </li>
                <li>India ranks 19th in terms of the number of names that feature in the papers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong> </strong><strong>What is the Multi-Agency Group?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The latest report comes a few months after a similar ‘Panama Papers’ disclosure that came in 2016.
                </li>
                <li>The Panama Papers named several prominent Indian politicians, actors, and businessmen as having
                    offshore undisclosed bank accounts.
                </li>
                <li>Following this, a Multi-Agency Group (MAG) was constituted.</li>
                <li>The government has now reconstituted this MAG led by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), to
                    investigate cases relating to the ‘Paradise Papers’ data disclosure.
                </li>
                <li>This will have representatives from CBDT, Enforcement Directorate, Reserve Bank of India and the
                    Financial Intelligence Unit.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong> </strong><strong>How are offshore companies a concern?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Legality</strong> – It is not necessarily illegal to set up offshore companies.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This is because India has double-taxation avoidance agreements (DTAAs) with several countries with
                    lower tax rates than its own.
                </li>
                <li>The companies incorporated in such countries can use their tax residency certificates (TRC) to enjoy
                    the tax benefits available legally.

            <p><strong> </strong><strong>Apprehensions </strong>– However, increasingly, companies and bank accounts are
                created overseas, providing nominee office-bearers and facilitating bank loans or transfer of shares in
                multiple secrecy jurisdictions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This essentially means using or incorporating overseas shell companies to take <u>tax advantages
                    through illegal means</u>.
                </li>
                <li>These include:</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <li>operating as fake entities and engaging in tax evasion, manipulation of the market, money
                    laundering, parking black money, etc.
                </li>
                <li>round tripping i.e. taking untaxed money out of the country through inflated invoices and then
                    bringing it back as investment.
                </li>
                <li>instances of assets of Indian companies being used to guarantee loans raised by offshore companies
                    without disclosing it to Indian regulators.
                </li>
                <li>changing ownership of offshore companies to actually change the ownership of shares held in Indian
                    companies without paying taxes in India.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Impediment</strong> – A company is generally entitled to arrange its financial affairs in
                whichever way it wishes, to reduce its tax liability.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The fact that the motive for a particular transaction is to avoid tax does not necessarily
                    invalidate the transaction unless the law of the land specifies so.
                </li>
                <li>There is a corporate army engaged in imaginative bookkeeping to discover and exploit legal loopholes
                    to evade tax in most cases.
                </li>
                <li>The burden of justification thus is always on the financial regulators.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Exposures</strong> – The recent disclosures help regulators overcome the obstacle of secrecy,
                enabling them to investigate instances of financial malpractices.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The sheer size of the Paradise Papers disclosures and the corporate-centric leads they provide, mark
                    a big step forward.
                </li>
                <li>Such insight into corporate ingenuity allows regulators to bring in better laws and global tax
                    reforms.

        <div id="Nov. 8 was"> 
            <ul>
                <li>Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said the twin blows of demonetisation and implementation of the
                    Goods and Services Tax (GST) were disastrous for the economy and “broke the back of businesses.”
                </li>
                <li>Singh launched a scathing attack on the NDA government and reiterated his statement in Parliament
                    that the note ban was “organised loot and legalised plunder.”
                </li>
                <li>“Demonetisation has proved to be mere bluster to reap political dividends while the real offenders
                    have escaped. I repeat, this was organised loot and legalised plunder,” Dr. Singh said, a day before
                    the controversial move’s first anniversary, which the Central government is celebrating as
                    “Anti-Black Money Day.”
                </li>
                <li>“One must remember that nowhere in the world has any democracy undertaken such a coercive move,
                    withdrawing 86% of legal tender in one single swoop.”

                <li>According to him, the growth in private investment is at a 25-year low, which is terrible for the

        <div id="India questions"> 
            <ul>
                <li>The climate change meet in Bonn must heed the 2015 targets, despite the U.S. reversal.</li>
                <li>The 23rd conference of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change under way in Bonn faces the
                    challenge of raising the ambition of the world’s leaders, and giving practical form to the
                    provisions of the Paris Agreement.
                </li>
                <li>Although 169 countries have ratified the accord, and there is tremendous support for greener,
                    low-risk pathways to growth worldwide, the Trump administration in the U.S., one of the top emitters
                    of greenhouse gases (GHGs), has announced it will withdraw from the pact.
                </li>
                <li>Even if it will take until 2020 to achieve an actual withdrawal, the U.S. action reverses the
                    overall momentum achieved in Paris in 2015, and negates President Barack Obama’s legacy of
                    regulations designed to reduce America’s GHG emissions, especially from the use of coal.
                </li>
                <li>It is heartening that China, which has achieved rapid economic growth and leads in GHG emissions, is
                    firmly behind the pact to reduce the risk of climate change.
                </li>
                <li>There is steady progress in the growth of renewable energy sources as they become cheaper and the
                    efficiency of solar, wind and energy storage technologies improves.
                </li>
                <li>The Agreement has a benchmark of raising $100 billion a year by 2020.</li>
                <li>The recent Emissions Gap Report from the UN underscores the terrible mismatch between the voluntary
                    pledges made by countries for the Paris Agreement and what is necessary to keep a rise in global
                    average temperature below 2º C, preferably 1.5º C.
                </li>
                <li>India’s emissions have been rising overall, but it has committed itself to lowering the emissions
                    intensity of its GDP by 33-35% by 2030 from the 2005 level.
                </li>
                <li>By some estimates, India has been awarded among the highest levels of multilateral climate funding
                    at $745 million since 2013.
                </li>
                <li>Securing funds for mitigation and adaptation is a high priority for India, but it must ensure that
                    States acquire the capacity to absorb such assistance efficiently.
                </li>
                <li>While the emphasis on a giant renewable energy programme has won global acclaim, the focus is
                    equally on India’s readiness to embrace green technologies across the spectrum of activity,
                    including buildings and transport.

                <p><strong>Explanation</strong> </p>
                <p>Stubble burning is the deliberate setting fire of the straw stubble that remains after wheat and
                    other grains have been harvested. The practice was widespread until the 1990s, when governments
                    increasingly restricted its use.<br/>
                    The burning of stubble, contrasted with alternatives such as ploughing the stubble back into the
                    ground has a number of consequences and effects on the environment<br/>
                    Stubble burning:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Quickly clears the field and is cheap.</li>
                    <li>Kills weeds, including those resistant to herbicide.</li>
                    <li>Kills slugs and other pests.</li>
                    <li>Can reduce nitrogen tie-up</li>
                </ul>
                <p>However, it has a number of harmful effects on the environment:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Loss of nutrients.</li>
                    <li>Pollution from smoke.</li>
                    <li>Damage to electrical and electronic equipment from floating threads of conducting waste.</li>
                    <li>Risk of fires spreading out of control.</li>

                        and get delivery at their doorstep.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Reason behind this move? </strong>doorstep delivery of fuel is a viable model to
                        increase digital transactions as well as shorten queues at petrol pumps.

                    <li>Indian Oil Corporation has come up with diesel as the fuel for this model. It is not as

                    <li>The Karnataka State Cabinet approved the <strong>Karnataka Prevention and Eradication of Inhuman
                        Evil Practices and Black Magic Bill, 2017 — better known as the anti-superstition Bill</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>The bill seeks to ban among other practices the controversial <strong>‘made snana’</strong>
                        ritual (devotees rolling over plantain leaves having food leftovers) in public/religious places.
                    </li>
                    <li>‘<strong>Made snana’</strong> is practised at Kukke Subrahmanya temple in Dakshina Kannada
                        district, in violation of human dignity.
                    </li>

                <p><strong>Bill seeks to ban:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Bill also encompasses ban on human sacrifice; coercing a person to perform fire-walk at
                        religious festivals; piercing jaw with rods, baibeega practice; pelting stones in the name of
                        banamathi, mata-mantra; creating panic in the minds of the people by invoking ghost or mantras;
                        claiming to perform surgery with fingers, or claiming to change the sex of foetus in the womb.
                    </li>
                    <li>It also seeks to ban practices against women: forcing them to stay in isolation; subjecting them
                        to inhuman and humiliating practices such as parading them naked in the name of worship
                        (betthale save); and sexual exploitation by invoking supernatural powers.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Bill fails to cover:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Regulations for astrology and vaastu practice, piercing of ears and nose of children in
                        accordance with certain rituals, and performance of religious rituals such as ‘Keshlochan’ by
                        the Jains.

                <ul>
                    <li>The Bill proposes appointment of a vigilance officer to monitor violations of the provisions of
                        the law and its rules.
                    </li>
                    <li>Violators of the law will be penalised, with imprisonment of not less than one year and a fine

                <p><strong>National Health Policy (NHP), 2017:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It overlooks the rapid rise in the share of the old (60 years or more), and associated
                        morbidities, especially sharply rising non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and disabilities.
                    </li>
                    <li>With rising age, numerous physiological changes occur and the risk of chronic diseases rises.
                    </li>
                    <li>It fails to make a distinction between the aged in general and those suffering from chronic
                        conditions
                    </li>
                    <li>Based on the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) 2015, among aged males and females, those
                        suffering from NCDs nearly doubled during 2005-12
                    </li>

                    <li>Staffs are not well trained to treat/advise the aged suffering from dementia or frailty</li>
                    <li>The quality of medical care is abysmal</li>
                    <li>Hospitalization costs are exorbitant and impoverishing.</li>
                    <li>Health insurance covers a fraction of medical expenses incurred.</li>
                    <li>A vast majority of those with NCDs had access to medical advice and treatment but the proportion
                        remained unchanged during 2005-12 ,because
                    </li>
                    <li>Heterogeneity in providers of medical help — from qualified doctors to faith healers and

                <ul>
                    <li>The link between loneliness and mortality is mediated by unhealthy behaviours and morbidity</li>
                    <li>Loneliness alters physiology at a more fundamental level.</li>
                    <li>Research shows that loneliness increases vascular resistance and diminishes immunity.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Networking as support</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Today, ‘women are increasingly filling other roles, which limits the capacity of women and
                        families to provide care for older people
                    </li>
                    <li>Children often play an important role in elderly support</li>
                    <li>If social networks are instrumental in bonding together in periods of personal crises, this
                        could compensate for a lack of family support
                    </li>
                    <li>But lack of social harmony induces helplessness, disruption of medical supplies and network
                        support.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Way forward</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Health systems have to be configured to deal with not one NCD but multiple NCDs to manage them
                        better.
                    </li>
                    <li>The reconfigured medical system must be complemented by stronger family ties and social
                        networks.
                    </li>
                    <li>Ageing in place can be further enhanced by creating age-friendly environments that enable
                        mobility and allow them to engage in basic activities.

                        <li>In August, India moved to include gold sales under the <strong>Prevention of Money
                            Laundering Act (PMLA).</strong></li>
                        <li>The law makes it mandatory for jewellers to keep records of customers’ personal

                    <p><strong>Key Fact:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Indian gold demand typically rises in the last three months of the year as consumers buy
                            more for the wedding season as well as for festivals such as Diwali and Dussehra.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>The World Gold Council estimate:</strong> India imported 120 tonnes of gold in 2016.
                        </li>
                        <li>In India, less than 4% of the people pay income tax. Many tax evaders choose to park their
                            illicit wealth in gold as it is nearly as liquid as currency in the country.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Present scenario:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The sales tax on gold rose to 3% from 1.2 % as part of a new nationwide sales tax regime
                            that started on July 1.
                        </li>
                        <li>Jewellers are buying smuggled gold at discount in cash, then making jewellery and selling it

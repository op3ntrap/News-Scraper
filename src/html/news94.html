            <p><strong>Supreme Court observations: </strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It was unfortunate to note that parents drive their minor children into marriage</li>
                <li>At least one in three marriages in rural areas involves girl children below the age of 18.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Petition filed by NGO Independent Thought:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contention: Petition challenges the Exception 2 to <strong>Section 375 (rape)</strong> of the Indian
                    Penal Code, which permits “intrusive sexual intercourse with a girl child aged between 15 and 18
                    only on the ground that she is married.”
                </li>
                <li>The Exception is part of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act of 2013 and is contrary to the anti-child
                    sex abuse law, <strong>Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act of 2012 (POCSO).</strong>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key stats: </strong>As per the <strong>Fourth National Family Health Survey</strong> of 2015-16,
                there are 26.8% of brides in the country who were married below the age of 18.</p>

                    <p><strong>What is MTP Act, 1971? </strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Abortion in India is legal only up to twenty weeks of pregnancy under specific conditions
                            and situations.
                        </li>
                        <li>One, the continuance of the pregnancy would involve a risk to the life of the pregnant woman
                            or of grave injury of physical or mental health, or
                        </li>
                        <li>Two, there is a substantial risk that if the child were born, it would suffer from such
                            physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped.<strong> </strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>What the draft MTP bill 2014 provides?</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The draft MTP increased the legal limit for abortion from 20 weeks to 24 weeks.</li>
                        <li>It provides for abortion beyond 24 weeks under defined conditions.</li>
                        <li>The Bill amends Section 3 of the 1971 Act to provide that “the length of pregnancy shall not
                            apply” in a decision to abort a foetus diagnosed with “substantial foetal abnormalities” or
                            if it is “alleged by the pregnant woman to have been caused by rape”.
                        </li>
                        <li>Under the 1971 Act, even pregnant rape victims cannot abort after 20 weeks, compelling them
                            to move court.
                        </li>
                        <li>It allows a woman to take an independent decision in consultation with a registered
                            health-care provider.
                        </li>
                        <li>It also takes into account the reality of a massive shortage of both doctors and trained
                            midwives, and seeks to allow Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha practitioners to carry out
                            abortions.<strong> </strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Why is it essential to change the MTP law?</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Foetal abnormalities show up only by 18 weeks, so just a two-week window after that is too
                            small for the would-be parents to take the difficult call on whether to keep their baby.
                        </li>
                        <li>Even for the medical practitioner, this window is too small to exhaust all possible options
                            before advising the patient.
                        </li>
                        <li>There is an urgent need to empower women with sexual rights, legal protection against sex
                            crimes and sex choices both in their own interest and for the sake of reducing the fertility
                            rate as a whole.
                        </li>
                        <li>The lack of legal approval moves abortion to underground and they are done in unhygienic
                            conditions by untrained, thus, putting thousands of women at risk.
                        </li>

            <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>After more than two months, the India-China standoff in Doklam, came to an end.</li>
                <li>Chinese accepted to cease the construction of road, which in fact was the trigger behind the scenes.
                    Meanwhile Indian troops retreated as a concession to the decision.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Chinese escalations along the Sikkim sector that is an advantageous military zone for India could
                    have been costlier.
                </li>
                <li>The forthcoming Brics summit, which they will be hosting in Xiamen, must have also played a role in
                    Chinese concern.
                </li>
                <li>India should not believe the Chinese tactical move and get into a conclusion that former would stop
                    its incursions into disputed and other’s territories.
                </li>
                <li>India brilliantly utilized the denial tactics to prevent China from adjusting the facts on the
                    ground.
                </li>
                <li>China’s rise is a challenge to India’s supremacy in South Asia.</li>
                <li>Looks like despite being aware of its disadvantages in Chumbi Valley, Chinese played the card to
                    trigger a rift between New Delhi and Thimphu.
                </li>
                <li>But Thimphu upheld its calm endorsed India’s position by calling for a return to the status quo
                    ante.
                </li>
                <li>But on the other the relationship of India with its other neighbours is unlike with that of Bhutan.
                    For example, In Pakistan, China has assisted the establishment of a nuclear-armed state which
                    deploys terrorists against Indiato achieve its territorially revisionist goals.
                </li>
                <li>Chinese presence in the Indian ocean region is also a threat to Indian supremacy.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Way forward</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>India should be prepared with its diplomatic and military apparatus to prevent Doklam-type
                    unilateral adventurism again.
                </li>
                <li>India should also exploit its advantages of geography</li>
                <li>Initiate closer military partnership with the US and Japan. </li>

                <li>The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India is likely to come out with its recommendations on the
                    long-pending controversial issue of net neutrality in a month’s time.
                </li>
                <li>The issue has been debated since early 2015 in India.</li>
                <li><strong>What is net neutrality?</strong> Net Neutrality is the principle that service providers
                    should treat all data on the Internet equally, and not discriminate or charge differently by user,
                    content, site, platform, or application.
                </li>
                <li>Demanding that the same rule should apply for the same services, telecom operators have reasoned
                    that operators are required to ensure service quality and pay levies to the government, while no
                    such rules are applicable on Internet-based calling applications such as Whatsapp and Skype.
                </li>
                <li>After a series of consultation papers on related topics such as over-the-top service providers and
                    differential pricing of data services, TRAI had released a consultation paper on ‘Net neutrality’.
                </li>
                <li>The regulator had last year barred telecom service providers from charging differential rates for
                    data services, effectively prohibiting Facebook’s Free Basics and Airtel Zero platform.

                            <strong>rifampicin,</strong> one of the standard key TB drugs, within 90 minutes.

                <li><strong>Why are we unable to eliminate TB?</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Inability to rapidly diagnose multi-drug resistant tuberculosis has long been identified as
                            among the chinks in India’s strategy to eliminate tuberculosis.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Lack of logistics</strong>: There are only around 600 GeneXpert devices now in use —
                            roughly one for each district — and this posed a stumbling block to deploying the
                            WHO-recommended kits earlier.

                        <li>It requires air-conditioned settings and reliable electricity access for optimal output.
                        </li>
                        <li>The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is in the process of testing a cheaper
                            alternative to GeneXpert called <strong>Truenat MTB,</strong> which is reportedly more
                            portable, battery-operated, and performs as well at lower costs.

            <ul>
                <li>Repeal of Article 35A that protects the unique identity of Dogras will test the relationship between
                    J&amp;amp;K and the rest of the country.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The cultural identity and very existence of Jammu and Kashmir, which was recognized as an example of
                    cultural assimilation and co-existence is at, peril now.
                </li>
                <li>Article 35A of the Constitution is more relevant for the Duggar region of Jammu than Kashmir and
                    Ladakh for a variety of reasons.
                </li>
                <li>Repeal of this article will lead to the economic deprivation and erosion of cultural identity of the
                    Dogras.
                </li>
                <li>The last Dogra ruler of Jammu and Kashmir, Maharaja Hari Singh introduced these laws in 1927 to
                    safeguard the interests of his subjects and to shield them from domination by elite and affluent
                    non-state subjects.
                </li>
                <li>Those wanting to trample the unique identity of the Duggar land are spreading the rumor that
                    repealing Article 35A will give a boost to development in Jammu.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why should the scrapping of 35A, therefore, be wrongly linked to the lack of industrial growth in
                Jammu and Kashmir?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A misguiding move initiated that Article 35A will lead to the integration of Jammu and Kashmir with
                    the rest of India.
                </li>
                <li>But Jammu and Kashmir is a part of India and the relationship with the nation was inked on October
                    26, 1947 through the Instrument of Accession signed by Maharaja Hari Singh, then ruler of Jammu and
                    Kashmir, and Lord Mountbatten, the Viceroy of India, which were incorporated into the Indian
                    Constitution as Article 370.
                </li>
                <li>But the real fact is that removing Article 35A could lead to a squeeze in opportunities for the
                    Dogra youth.
                </li>
                <li>Where they will have to compete with youth from other states for jobs,Professional academic courses,
                    recruitment in the security forces and denied scholarships and other financial assistance.
                </li>
                <li>The marginal and medium-level traders will face increased competition.</li>
                <li>The influx of “non-subjects”, in the absence of the repeal of Article 35A, will put immense pressure
                    on landholdings.
                </li>
                <li>Thus the fight to protect Article 35 A is the fight to protect Dogra Dugar land.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The base effect refers to the impact of the rise in price level (i.e. last year’s inflation)
                            in the previous year over the corresponding rise in price levels in the current year (i.e.,
                            current inflation): if the price index had risen at a high rate in the corresponding period
                            of the previous year leading to a high inflation rate, some of the potential rise is already
                            factored in, therefore a similar absolute increase in the Price index in the current year
                            will lead to a relatively lower inflation rates. On the other hand, if the inflation rate
                            was too low in the corresponding period of the previous year, even a relatively smaller rise
                            in the Price Index will arithmetically give a high rate of current inflation.

                <li>Proposal called for the <strong>develelimination</strong> — by developed countries — of the most

                <li><strong>Contention</strong>: Developed countries, including the US, the EU and Canada, have been

                        <p>Objective of “Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY)” is ensuring access to various financial
                            services like availability of basic savings bank account, access to need based credit,
                            remittances facility, insurance and pension to the excluded sections i.e. weaker sections
                            &amp; low income groups. This deep penetration at affordable cost is possible only with
                            effective use of technology.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>PMJDY is a National Mission on Financial Inclusion encompassing an integrated approach to
                            bring about comprehensive financial inclusion of all the households in the country. The plan
                            envisages universal access to banking facilities with at least one basic banking account for
                            every household, financial literacy, access to credit, insurance and pension facility. In
                            addition, the beneficiaries would get RuPay Debit card having inbuilt accident insurance
                            cover of र 1 lakh. The plan also envisages channeling all Government benefits (from Centre /
                            State / Local Body) to the beneficiaries accounts and pushing the Direct Benefits Transfer
                            (DBT) scheme of the Union Government. The technological issues like poor connectivity,
                            on-line transactions will be addressed. Mobile transactions through telecom operators and
                            their established centres as Cash Out Points are also planned to be used for Financial
                            Inclusion under the Scheme. Also an effort is being made to reach out to the youth of this
                            country to participate in this Mission Mode Programme.</p></li>

        <p><strong>Topic: CASE STUDY ANALYSIS</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Question 1. </strong>You are working as Junior Engineer in a Tehsil. You have been given
            responsibility to measure MGNREGA works undertaken by 3 Gram Panchayats.</p>
        <p>You have authority to give technical sanctions to all MGNREGA works. In one of these Panchayats you notice
            that your predecessor had wrongly measured many works, and in many cases he had approved works that never
            existed. One day few elected members of that Panchayat with bundle of job cards come to you to seek
            ‘sanction’ for the works done by them. When enquired, they reveal that they were contractors who had
            completed works under MGNREGA. When you reject their demand, they threaten you and tell you that the
            previous Junior Engineer was made to quit his job because he didn’t listen to them. This is your first job
            and is very important to sustain your family. There have been precedents in the past that some junior
            officials were beaten to death in some parts of the Tehsil.</p>
        <p>What will you do in this situation? Explain in detail citing rules from MGNREGA Act.<strong> </strong></p>
        <p><span><em><strong>Answer</strong></em></span></p>
        <ul>
            <li>I would tell contractor that there is provision of social audit for MGNREGA and in future it is most
                likely that they would get caught in future. Also the provision of DBT and biometric authentication will
                reveal all their wrong doings.
            </li>
            <li>Subsequently i will report such incidence to my higher authorities and seek police protection in case my
                life is at risk. A report of bogus as well as valid JOB card shall be separately prepared by me which
                shall lie as a proof for all past irregularities.
            </li>
            <li>My courage and uprightness will deter me from succumbing to their demands. In any case if i comply as
                directed by contractors, my job would be in peril. Truth can’t be hidden for long and its better to be
                courageous than to hide facts and face future actions.
            </li>
        </ul>

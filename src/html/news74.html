                <li><strong>Human Resource development Ministry: </strong></li>
                <li>Advised all states and Union territories to have at least one <strong>government-run English-medium
                    school</strong> in each block.
                </li>
                <li>English should be taught as a compulsory subject from Class VI</li>

            <p><strong>Key Fact</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>There are a total of <strong>6,612 blocks</strong> in the country.</li>
                <li>Since establishment of schools is a matter of state policy, the HRD can issue only advice in this
                    regards.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why this move?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The number of students enrolling in English–medium schools has doubled from 1.5 crore in 2008-09 to
                    2.9 crore in 2013-14. As a consequence, more states have started offering the option of English as a

            <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2017 passed by Rajya Sabha.</li>
                <li>The Bill seeks to replace <strong>the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Ordinance</strong>, that was
                    passed in May 2017
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why was the ordinance passed?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>To address high levels of stress faced by the banking sector at the time.</li>
                <li>Previously in the month of June, The RBI had identified 12 ‘defaulters’ who account for around 25%
                    of India’s <strong>non-performing assets (NPA)</strong> and informed banks to take up insolvency
                    proceedings against them.
                </li>
                <li>Steel, Infrastructure, Power and Textiles are the sectors with the most NPAs.</li>
                <li>Public sector banks were hit the most as large modern and foundation programs were bolstered by them
                    with the expectation that there would be further extension.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What does the Bill do?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It empowers RBI to give directions to banks to act against loan defaulters.</li>
                <li>The Bill seeks to amend <strong>the Banking Regulation Act, 1949</strong> by inserting provisions
                    for handling cases related to stressed assets.
                </li>
                <li>Stressed assets are loans on which the borrower has defaulted or it has been restructured.</li>
                <li>The Central Government can authorise the RBI to issue directions to banks for initiating proceedings
                    in case of a default in loan repayment. These proceedings would be under the Insolvency and
                    Bankruptcy Code, 2016.
                </li>
                <li>The RBI may also form committees to advise banks on the resolution of stressed assets. The members
                    will be appointed or approved by the RBI.
                </li>

            <p><strong>In news:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A team of researchers from IIT Hyderabad has been working to use the <strong>Internet of Things
                    (IoT) </strong>to accurately diagnose <strong>kidney</strong> and <strong>liver disorders</strong>
                    with the help of <strong>ultrasound scanning devices</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>The technology can identify kidney stones and cysts and also grade a “fatty liver” classification.
                    Even it can differentiate between cysts and stones in the kidney images.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Disadvantages of using Internet-enabled scanning systems:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>In the traditional way of processing data, after the patient is scanned, a radiologist usually picks
                    out the most relevant portions or even captures screenshots and makes these available for diagnosis
                    by the specialist.
                </li>
                <li>In the IoT-enabled remote scanning, if the scans are uploaded to the cloud without being first
                    analysed, there is a possibility that the doctor sees a huge amount of data, which they may find
                    difficult to interpret.
                </li>
                <li>Preliminary classification of images is a must in case of Internet enabled scanning system.</li>

                <li>Scientists have effectively altered the hereditary (genetic) code of piglets to evacuate lethargic
                    viral contaminations.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>A major Breakthrough:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>This could eventually pave the way for animal-to-human organ transplants.</li>
                <li>Save lives by reducing organ donor waiting lists that have risen over the years.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key Fact</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>117,000 people on the U.S. transplant waiting list alone and according to official data, 22 people
                    die each day waiting for an organ.
                </li>
                <li>People would already be able to get pig heart valves and pancreases.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Scientists still need to alter pig genes to abstain from setting off a human resistant framework

                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                    <p>The Grizzled Squirrel Wildlife Sanctuary (GSWS) is located in Virudhunagar and Madurai districts
                        of <strong>Tamil Nadu</strong> and covers an area 485.2 sq Kms. Over 240+ species of birds are
                        seen in this sanctuary including 14 species of birds endemic to the Western Ghats, such as the
                        critically endangered Oriental white-backed vulture and the long-billed vulture. In addition to
                        grizzled giant squirrels, the sanctuary is home to numerous animals such as barking deer, bonnet
                        macaque, common langur, elephants, flying squirrels, gaur, Indian giant squirrel, leopard,
                        lion-tailed macaques, mouse deer, Nilgiri langur and Nilgiri Tahrs. There are over 220 species
                        of butterflies including many rare and endemic species. Some of the rare butterflies spotted
                        here include Eversheds ace , Silver royal , Orange awlet , Hampsons hedge blue , etc.</p></div>

                    <p><strong>More aerosol in atmosphere results in heavier rainfall</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>What’s in news?</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Earlier belief: </strong>pre-monsoon aerosol loading results in decrease in seasonal
                            rainfall due to aerosol-solar radiation interactions.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>New Findings: </strong></li>
                        <li>Long-term (2002-2013) satellite observational study and model-based analysis by researchers
                            from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur has found that higher aerosol loading
                            results in <strong>delayed but more rainfall over Central and Northern India.</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Higher aerosol loading changes cloud properties in terms of size (both height and
                            width) and microphysics, which results in more rainfall.</strong></li>
                        <li>When aerosol particles are higher, the number of nucleation sites increases resulting in far
                            too many number of droplets. Under such circumstances, it takes time for the droplets to
                            grow in size through condensation.

                <li>There is a disaster-prone State having frequent landslides, forest fires, cloudbursts, flash floods
                    and earthquakes, etc. Some of these are seasonal and often unpredictable. The magnitude of the
                    disaster is always unanticipated. During one of the seasons, a cloudburst caused devastating floods
                    and landslides leading to high casualties. There was major damage to infrastructure like roads,
                    bridges and power generating units. This led to more than 100000 pilgrims, tourists and other locals
                    trapped across different routes and locations. The people trapped in your area of responsibility
                    included senior citizens, patients in hospitals, women and children, hikers, tourists, ruling
                    party’s regional president along with his family, additional jail. As secretary State and prisoners
                    in jail.<br/> As a civil services officer of the State, what would be the order in which you would
                    rescue these people and why? Give justifications.

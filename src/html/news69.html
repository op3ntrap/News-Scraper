                <li>The Karnataka State Cabinet approved a cultural policy for the State, perhaps the first in India to
                    have such a comprehensive policy, aimed at promoting Kannada culture and language.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Major focus areas of policy:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Aim at formulating measures to curb the tendency of banning Kannada books for trivial reasons</li>
                <li>Decentralization of the Department of Kannada and Culture</li>
                <li>Formation of search committees to select chairpersons to various academies and authorities to
                    de-politicise appointments
                </li>
                <li>Establishment of art galleries in every district</li>
                <li>Formulation of separate programmes to help artistes in distress</li>
                <li>Establishment of separate Bayalata, Sugama Sangeeta and Nritya academies, and giving priority to

                    studied the recommendations, including the financial implications of implementing it. After the
                    sub-committee showed the green signal, the Cabinet approved it.

            <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Recent decision of Government on scrapping No-detention policy in school and its possible
                    implication on primary education on India
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What is the ‘no-detention policy’?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The right to education act provides the guarantee of uninterrupted schooling under sections 16 and
                    30(1) is founded on the no-detention policy until Class 8
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why is scrapping ‘no-detention policy’ a bad decision?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The no-detention policy to promote students automatically to higher classes every year till Class
                    VIII was instituted to check the high number of dropouts
                </li>
                <li>The socially and economically disadvantaged sections were getting the benefits of this policy</li>
                <li>According to many experts, the NDP was wrongly interpreted to create an environment in which the
                    significance of evaluating a student’s learning outcomes was undermined
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Continuous Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE)</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is aimed to assess the child’s understanding of what was being taught in class at periodic
                    intervals
                </li>
                <li>This is the reason behind the decision of scrapping NDP, as this evaluation process shows bad
                    results of evaluations of students
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>CCE and its drawbacks:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Teachers were not given adequate training to undertake this reform of CCE</li>
                <li>Schools are not fully compliant with the RTE’s requirements on infrastructure and teacher
                    availability
                </li>
                <li>In fact, about 8 per cent primary schools have just one teacher</li>
                <li>These situations made CCE, an ineffective reform</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The way forward</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The RTE Act has a provision for continuous and comprehensive evaluation, the government should work
                    on it
                </li>
                <li>But transferring the responsibility of performance to children, many of whom come from
                    underprivileged backgrounds, can only produce a less literate citizenry
                </li>
                <li>The move to scrap the NDP will make the RTE’s goal of inclusive education a very difficult one</li>
                <li>The government should rethink the move</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Home Ministry has proposed to amend the law to insert two stricter <strong>anti-racial
                    discrimination</strong> provisions in the Indian Penal Code
                </li>

                <li>Uttar Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya and Mizoram</li>
                <li>Three Union Territories — Andaman and Nicobar, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, and Lakshwadeep.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What is the proposed amendment?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Home Ministry has proposed to amend two provisions in the IPC, that is, <strong>Section
                    153A</strong> and <strong>Section 509A</strong>.

            </ul>
            <p><strong>Panel recommendations</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The proposed amendments were based on the recommendations of the Bezbaruah Committee, constituted by
                    the Centre in February 2014 in the wake of a series of racial attacks on persons belonging to the
                    northeast.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Community social media platform ‘LocalCircles’ survey shows Indian consumer’s perception about items
                    imported from China.
                </li>
                <li>52% of participants opined that quality of a ‘Made in India’ version was superior to the one from
                    China.
                </li>
                <li>83% said they buy Chinese products as those items were the cheapest and 98% said there should be
                    better screening and ensure that imports meets the Indian (BIS) standards.
                </li>
                <li>The poll assumes significance as it comes amid ongoing negotiations for Regional Comprehensive
                    Economic Partnership (RCEP)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP)</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is a FTA between the 10-member ASEAN bloc and its six FTA partners — India, China, Japan, South
                    Korea, Australia and New Zealand.
                </li>
                <li>When inked, it would become the world’s biggest free trade pact</li>
                <li>Boost goods trade by eliminating most tariff and non-tariff barriers — and provide the region’s
                    consumers greater choice of quality products at affordable rates.
                </li>
                <li>Liberalise investment norms and do away with services trade restrictions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>India’s concerns over RCEP</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>China is keen on an agreement on a ‘high level’ of tariff liberalisation — eliminating duties on as
                    much as 92% of traded products.
                </li>
                <li>India’s offer is to do away with duties on only 80% of the lines and that too, with a longer
                    phase-out period for Chinese imports
                </li>
                <li>India already has separate FTAs with the 10-member ASEAN bloc, India feels that on account of the
                    RCEP, India may not gain much on the goods side with existing FTA partners
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Duty impact on India</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A highly ambitious level of tariff elimination without enough flexibility would affect India the
                    most on the goods side.
                </li>
                <li>This is because in the RCEP group (except Myanmar, Cambodia and Lao PDR), India has the highest
                    average ‘Most Favoured Nation (MFN) tariff’ level at 13.5%.
                </li>
                <li>MFN tariff, as per the WTO, refers to normal, non-discriminatory tariff charged on imports,
                    excluding preferential tariffs under FTAs and other schemes
                </li>
                <li>India is the only participant that has a high level of merchandise trade deficit</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Trade deficit woes</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Even without a bilateral FTA, India was already affected by China’s overhang of excess capacity in
                    sectors including metals, chemicals and textiles.
                </li>
                <li>Goods imports from China have been far outpacing India’s shipments to that country</li>
                <li>This has led to goods trade deficit with China widening from just $1.1 billion in 2003-04 to a
                    whopping $52.7 billion in 2015-16
                </li>
                <li>The initiative could provide a means for Chinese industries with excess capacity to export equipment
                    that is currently idle.

        <div id="Let’s talk">
            <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Applicability of the concept of basic income to India.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Universal Basic Income</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The primary objective is to enable every citizen to have a certain minimum income.</li>
                <li>The term ‘universal’ is meant to connote that the minimum or basic income will be provided to
                    everyone irrespective of whatever their current income is.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Problem with UBI:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Adoption of UBI can impose a burden on the fisc which is well beyond the capabilities of most
                    developing countries, including India.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Cash v/s Services: Whether support to vulnerable sections should be in the form of goods and
                services or as cash?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Cash</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It gives the discretion to beneficiaries to spend it any way they like</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Services</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provision of services or goods directly to beneficiaries may be directed to achieve certain
                    objectives in terms of nutrition or health or education.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Concerns</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>In the provision of services, the concern is about leakages and quality of service</li>
                <li>There are a whole lot of services provided by the state, and it would be impossible to knock them
                    off and substitute them with general income support
                </li>
                <li>Poor quality of services from government-run institutions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Universal’ or restricted?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is necessary to first decide whether income supplements should be ‘universal’ or limited to
                    certain easily identifiable groups.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Universal</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Universal scheme is easy to implement</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Income to one and all are beyond the capabilities of the present Central government Budget unless
                    the basic income is fixed at too low a level.
                </li>
                <li>It is extremely difficult to cut so-called implied subsidies or hidden subsidies in order to fund
                    resources.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Restricted</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The attempt must be to think in terms of reducing the number of beneficiaries using easily definable
                    criteria.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Strict targeting will run into complex problems of identification.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Minimum increase?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Whether the scheme should be universal or restricted depends on the level of basic income that is
                    proposed to be provided.
                </li>
                <li>If we were to treat the cut-off used to define poverty as the minimum income, then the total fiscal
                    burden would be enormous.
                </li>
                <li>Analysis using different poverty lines shows that poverty is concentrated around the poverty line.
                    In fact, more than 60% of the total poor lies between 75% of the poverty line.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Way out:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>What is needed is a supplement to fill the poverty gap</li>
                <li>One alternative would be to determine the required income supplement from the Mahatma Gandhi
                    National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS).
                </li>
                <li>The total annual income supplement can be equivalent to 100 days of the wages that is ₹20,000 per
                    year. This amount can be treated as the income supplement.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Feasibility :</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is difficult to cover the entire population. Even providing one person per household with this
                    income will mean ₹5 lakh crore per annum, which is 3% of GDP
                </li>
                <li>What is feasible is a scheme which limits the total expenditure to around 1.5 to 2% of GDP.</li>
                <li>One way of restricting the total cost to this amount is to limit it to all women above the age of
                    45.
                </li>
                <li>Restricting the beneficiaries to the elderly or widows or those with disabilities may have only a
                    limited impact.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Financing the scheme?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Remove all exemptions in our tax system.</li>
                <li>Tax experts advocate removing exemptions so that the basic tax rate can be reduced</li>
                <li>Phase out the MGNREGS, which will realise close to ₹40,000 crore.</li>
                <li>Fertilizer subsidies are another item of expenditure which can be eliminated</li>
                <li>Requesting higher income groups to forego supplemental income will reduce the expenditure, as has
                    been done successfully in the case of cooking gas.
                </li>

        <div id="Should we">
            <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence‘and possible dangers that can come out of it</p>
            <p><strong>Why one must not “fear” Artificial Intelligence?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Such systems are actually pretty dumb</li>
                <li>This is because even the most intelligent systems today with artificial specific intelligence can
                    perform one task better than any human can, but only that one task
                </li>
                <li>Any simple task that it is not specifically programmed for, such a system would find impossible to
                    complete
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Concerns related to Artificial Intelligence</strong></p>
            <p><strong>(1) Jobs</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The possible negative effect of Artificial Intelligence on jobs has been a trending topic recently
                </li>
                <li>But there has been no academic or policy consensus on what the exact effect will be</li>
                <li>Still there can be no doubt that at least some jobs will be negatively affected by Artificial
                    Intelligence
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>(2) Weapons</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The use of Artificial Intelligence in weapons leading to ‘autonomous weapons’ raises a number of
                    difficult questions in international law
                </li>
                <li>A machine that has been given the ability to make life and death decisions on the battlefield can be
                    dangerous
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>(3) Data Security</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The entire Artificial Intelligence ecosystem is built on the availability of great amounts of data
                    and enhancing efficiency requires continued availability of such data
                </li>
                <li>This raises the question of where the required data comes from, and who owns and controls it</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The way forward                                    </strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is necessary to assess the practical benefits and risks associated with the increasing prevalence
                    of Artificial Intelligence
                </li>

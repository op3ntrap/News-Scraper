                <ul>
                    <li>The Constitution Bench has to decide on the limited issue whether the order in M Nagaraj vs the
                        Union of India needs to be looked at afresh.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Constitution Bench will not go into the merit of the matter.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The 2006 Judgment</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In 2006, a five-judge Constitution Bench had ruled that the state was not bound to provide
                        reservation for SCs/STs in promotions.
                    </li>
                    <li>But in case any state wished to make such a provision, it was required to collect quantifiable
                        data showing backwardness of the class as well as its inadequate representation in public
                        employment.
                    </li>
                    <li>Additionally, the state was required to ensure that reservation does not breach the 50 percent
                        ceiling, adversely affect the creamy layer or extend it indefinitely.
                    </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Acting on a 2015 petition filed by the Tripura government which challenged an order of the
                        Tripura High Court, a two-judge bench referred the matter to a Constitution Bench under Article
                        145(3).
                    </li>
                    <li>A petition before the High Court had challenged certain provisions of The Tripura Scheduled
                        Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Reservation of vacancies in services and posts) Act, 1991, saying
                        that under these provisions, the state had granted reservation in violation of rules laid down
                        in M Nagaraj vs Union of India case.

                <ul>
                    <li>The CJI is examining the issue whether a two-judge judge bench directly refers a matter to
                        Constitution Bench
                    </li>

                    <li>The Union government is working on a “rent a roof” policy to support its ambitious plan to
                        generate 40 gigawatts (GW) of power from solar rooftop projects by 2022
                    </li>
                    <li>While investors have been enthused by India’s large ground-mounted, grid-connected solar parks,
                        the solar rooftop market hasn’t gained much traction
                    </li>
                    <li>Of India’s ambitious target of 175GW of clean energy capacity by 2022, 100GW is to come from
                        solar projects
                    </li>
                    <li>Of these, while 60GW is targeted from ground-mounted, grid-connected projects, 40GW is to come
                        from solar rooftop projects. Wind power projects are to contribute 60GW

                    <li>The country offers a big opportunity given its 750GW potential as it records around 300 sunny
                        days a year, with an average solar radiation range of 4-7 kilowatt-hours per square metre.

                <p><strong>Various Concerns:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>According to some experts, there are concerns as India is not expected to achieve even half of
                        the solar rooftop targets by December 2021
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Government Strategy for Wind power Projects</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The central government is also firming up its strategy to expedite bidding out wind power
                        contracts
                    </li>
                    <li>India has an installed wind power capacity of 33GW</li>
                    <li>The country has auctioned 2GW of wind power contracts that saw tariffs fall to a record low of
                        Rs2.64 per unit in the October auction conducted by state-run Solar Energy Corp. of India

                <ul>
                    <li>Scientists have identified a <strong>genetic mutation</strong> — found in an Indiana Amish
                        family — that may extend life by up to ten years, and are now testing an experimental
                        “longevity” drug that recreates the effect.
                    </li>
                    <li>The genetic mutation, discovered by the Northwestern University in the United States in an
                        extended family of <strong>Old Order Amish</strong> living in the vicinity of Berne, Indiana,
                        appears to protect against multiple aspects of biological ageing in humans.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Key Facts:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Indiana Amish kindred with the mutation live more than 10 per cent longer and have 10 per cent
                        longer telomeres (a protective cap at the end of our chromosomes that is a biological marker of
                        ageing) compared to Amish kindred members who do not have the mutation.
                    </li>
                    <li>Amish with this mutation also have significantly less diabetes and lower fasting insulin
                        levels.
                    </li>
                    <li>A composite measure that reflects vascular age also is lower — indicative of retained
                        flexibility in blood vessels in the carriers of the mutation — than those who do not have the
                        mutation, the research also found.
                    </li>
                    <li>These Amish individuals have very low levels of PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor), a
                        protein that comprises part of a “molecular fingerprint” related to ageing or senescence of
                        cells.It was previously known that PAI-1 was related to ageing in animals but unclear how it
                        affected ageing in humans.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The community’s origins:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Amish kindred in Berne, Indiana, have been genetically and culturally isolated and most are
                        at least distantly related.
                    </li>
                    <li>The ancestors of the Indiana Amish emigrated in the middle of the 19th century from Berne,
                        Switzerland.
                    </li>
                    <li>The mutation was introduced into the Amish kindred by farmers from Switzerland, who moved into
                        the area.
                    </li>
                    <li>Two of their descendants, who carried the mutation, married into the Amish community. The Amish
                        community outside the Berne area does not carry this mutation.
                    </li>
                    <li>People with the mutation live to be 85 on average, significantly longer than their predicted
                        average lifespan of 71 for Amish in general and which has not changed much over the last
                        century.

                    <li>The Union Cabinet approved the creation of <strong>the National Anti-profiteering
                        Authority</strong> to ensure that businesses pass on the benefits of GST to consumers.
                    </li>
                    <li>The authority has been granted wide-ranging powers, including to cancel the registration of
                        offending firms in extreme cases.
                    </li>
                    <li>The apex body has been mandated to ensure that the benefits of the reduction in GST rates on
                        goods or services are passed on to the ultimate consumers by way of a reduction in prices.
                    </li>
                    <li>According to the rules, if the NAA confirms that there is a need to apply <strong>anti-profiteering</strong>
                        measures, then it has the authority to order the supplier to reduce its prices or return the
                        undue benefit availed by it along with interest to the recipient of the goods or services. If
                        this can’t be done, then the company can be ordered to deposit the amount in the Consumer
                        Welfare Fund.
                    </li>
                    <li>In extreme cases, the NAA can impose a penalty on the defaulting business entity and even order
                        the cancellation of its registration under GST.

                <ul>
                    <li>As air quality in major cities of Uttar Pradesh hovers around “very poor” and “severe,” the
                        State government has banned garbage burning in urban areas in a bid to reduce the pollution.
                    </li>
                    <li>The State government has also sought technological assistance from the Indian Institute of
                        Technology, Kanpur, to create artificial rain.
                    </li>
                    <li>The government is also considering a review of old vehicles. It could remove them from roads, if
                        necessary, to reduce vehicular pollution.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Key Fact:</strong> The Air Quality Index of major cities in Uttar radesh like Moradabad,
                        Lucknow, Kanpur, Ghaziabad, Varanasi and Noida has consistently been in the higher range of 400.
                        It even touched 500 on a few days leaving the residents worried.

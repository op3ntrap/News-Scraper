            <ul>
                <li><strong>Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code</strong>, which defines rapes, makes an exception for
                    marital rape by stating, <strong>“Sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife, the wife not being
                        under fifteen years of age, is not rape.”</strong></li>
                <li>Central government had filed an affidavit in Delhi High Court, arguing against the decriminalization
                    of marital rape on the ground that it may “<strong>destabilise the institution of
                        marriage”.</strong></li>
                <li>The grounds for “marital immunity” for rape prosecution were laid by Chief Justice Sir Matthew Hale
                    in The History of the Pleas of the Crown, published in 1736, which is called as <strong>‘Implied
                        Consent Theory of Sir Hale’</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>This theory found its way into the legal system of all former British colonies.</li>
                <li>Australia in 1970’s, was the first common law country to pass reforms criminalizing rape in
                    marriage.
                </li>
                <li>In 1950’s, several Scandinavian countries and countries in the Communist bloc passed laws
                    criminalizing spousal rape including Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and the former Soviet Union and
                    Czechoslovakia. <strong>(Poland in 1932 was the first</strong>)
                </li>
                <li>Since the 1980s, many common law countries (include South Africa, Ireland, Canada, the United
                    States, New Zealand, Malaysia, Ghana, and Israel) have legislatively abolished the marital rape
                    immunity.
                </li>
                <li>In the US all 50 states made marital rape a crime.</li>
                <li>UK repealed its common law code that a marriage contract implied a woman’s consent to all sexual
                    activity.
                </li>
                <li>In <strong>2002, Nepal got rid of the marital rape</strong> exception after its Supreme Court held
                    that it went <strong>against the constitutional right of equal protection and the right to
                        privacy.</strong></li>
                <li>According to the <strong>UN Women’s 2011 report</strong>, out of 179 countries for which data was
                    available, <strong>52 had amended their legislation to explicitly make marital rape a criminal
                        offence.</strong></li>

            <p><strong>In news:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>The new Consumer Protection Bill 2016:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It seeks to replace a 31-year-old archaic law, <strong>the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.</strong>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Highlights of the Bill</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It provides a mechanism for redressal of complaints regarding defect in goods and deficiency in
                    services.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Consumer Dispute Redressal Commissions</strong> will be set up at the district, state and
                    national levels for adjudicating consumer complaints.
                </li>
                <li>The Bill establishes a <strong>Consumer Protection Authority</strong> to investigate into consumer
                    complaints, issue safety notices for goods and services, and pass orders for recall of goods and
                    against misleading advertisements.
                </li>
                <li>If a consumer suffers an injury from a defect in a good, he may file a claim of <strong>product
                    liability</strong> against the manufacturer.
                </li>
                <li>The Bill classifies six contract terms as ‘unfair’. These cover terms such as (i) payment of
                    excessive security deposits; (ii) disproportionate penalty for a breach ; (iii) unilateral
                    termination without cause; (iv) one which puts the consumer at a disadvantage.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Product liability:</strong> If defects in the manufacture, construction, design, testing, service
                marketing etc. of a product results in any personal injury or property damage to a consumer, the
                manufacturer is liable in a product liability action.</p>
            <p><strong>Rights of consumers:</strong> The rights of consumers include the right to: (i) be protected
                against marketing of goods and services which are hazardous to life and property, (ii) be informed of
                the quality, quantity, potency, purity, standard and price of goods or services, (iii) be assured of
                access to a variety of goods or services at competitive prices, and (iv) to seek redressal against
                unfair or restrictive trade practices.</p>
            <p><strong>Consumer Mediation Cell</strong>: The Bill introduces mediation as a mode of consumer dispute
                resolution. Consumer Mediation Cells will be established and attached to the redressal commissions at
                the district, state and national levels.</p>
            <p><strong>Penalties:</strong> Any person who fails to comply with an order of either of the Commissions
                would be liable for imprisonment from one month to three years, or with a fine from 10,000 rupees to
                50,000 rupees.</p>

            <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>SC judgment in the <strong>Gujarat shrines compensation case</strong> raises important questions.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Article 32 is the “soul of the Constitution”</strong> as it guarantees the citizens of their
                    fundamental rights under it.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The questions at the wake of the judgement are:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Should the court give relief in writ jurisdiction only when one’s right to life or personal liberty
                    under Article 21 is violated?
                </li>
                <li>Or can the state be held liable even with respect to violation of other fundamental rights such as
                    the freedom of religion?
                </li>
                <li>Will an order for the payment of compensation for the repair of religious places be contrary to
                    Article 27 of the Constitution?
                </li>
                <li>Article 27 prohibits the state from imposing any religious tax and the imposition of any tax whose
                    proceeds are used for the maintenance of any particular religion.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Keypoints:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>In the 2002 communal riots in Gujarat, as many as 567 religious places were either desecrated,
                    damaged or destroyed.
                </li>
                <li>On February 8, 2012, the Gujarat High Court ordered the state government to get these religious
                    places repaired and reimburse their owners/managers if they had already got them repaired.
                </li>
                <li>The Gujarat government appealed to the Supreme Court stating that for any loss of property, the
                    remedy is in civil law and in its writ jurisdiction under Article 226, cannot pass such an order as
                    the right to property after the 44th Amendment is not a fundamental right but simply a
                    constitutional right.
                </li>
                <li>The state government admitted that for the violation of the right to life and personal liberty, writ
                    jurisdiction of high courts could be invoked. But it argued that since India is a secular state it
                    couldn’t spend government money for any religious purpose due to Article 27.
                </li>
                <li>But the writ jurisdiction of high courts is wider than the apex court’s powers as while the SC can
                    issue writs just for the violation of fundamental rights, the HCs can do it additionally for the
                    violation of other rights.
                </li>
                <li>The respondents claimed that the right to equality and right to personal liberty was at stake during
                    the riots.
                </li>
                <li>The maintenance of law and order is the primary duty of the state government and the compensation is
                    not being sought for the maintenance of any particular religion but for the <strong>failure of the
                        government in fulfilling its basic duty.</strong></li>

            <p>(1) Backward Classes of the Citizens of in Article 16(4) can be identified on the basis of caste and not
                only on the economic basis.</p>
            <p>(2) Article 16(4) is not an exception to Article 16(1)</p>
            <p>(3) The backward classes in Article 16(4) are not similar to as socially backward classes in Article
                15(4) i.e. SC and ST</p>
            <p>(3) Creamy layer can be and must be eliminated from the Backward Classes</p>
            <p>(4) Article 16(4) permits the classification of backwards classes into more backward classes.</p>
            <p>(5) Reservation shall not exceed 50%. The court said that this rule should be applied every year.
                However, it may be relaxed in favour of people from far flung and remote areas because of their peculiar
                conditions. However, extreme caution should be exercised in doing so</p>
            <p>(6) Carry forward rule is valid but it is subject to 50%</p>

            <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bhutan rescues India’s interests at its own cost in the Doklam stand-off.</li>
                <li>In the Doklam stand-off, it was India’s security that was at stake, its “chicken neck” on the
                    line.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Keypoints:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>China came up with a <strong>“package deal” in 1990’s</strong>, where in return for the smaller
                    disputed Doklam area, it was willing to give bigger territorial concessions in disputed territories
                    in central Bhutan.
                </li>
                <li>It was an occasion for Bhutan to <strong>resolve its border dispute with China</strong> and also
                    <strong>benefit Chinese “goodwill”.</strong></li>
                <li>Importance of Doklam, from the Bhutanese point of geography, is <strong>neither strategically
                    important nor does it hold any economic value,</strong> as the stand-off area is frozen for most of
                    the year and nothing can grow up there.
                </li>
                <li>Bhutan in 1996 turned down the package deal offer mainly on the basis of Indian security concerns
                    over Doklam.
                </li>
                <li>As a result <strong>China was building six roads towards Bhutan</strong> with four roads already
                    intruding well into Bhutanese territory. Bhutan protested against this move and it resulted in
                    agreement to freeze the construction of roads.
                </li>
                <li>China, over the decades, has applied pressure on Bhutan, using various tactics so that Bhutan lets
                    go of the Doklam area.
                </li>
                <li>India never raised its voice in the past, about numerous Chinese incursions into the Bhutanese side,
                    including the more serious road-building activities. This is because they did not affect Indian
                    security, unlike Doklam.

                        <li><strong>Areas of reform:</strong> optimisation of signal establishments, restructuring of
                            repair echelons including base workshops, redeployment of ordnance depots, better
                            utilisation of supply and transport echelons and animal transport units, closure of military
                            farms and Army postal establishments in peace locations, and improving efficiency of the

            <ul>
                <li>The total rainfall (2017) in the country, is beyond the IMD’s forecast of a “normal” monsoon.</li>
                <li>The flood governance in India is still about ad hoc relief measures. It’s time to change.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Parts of Assam, Bihar and Gujarat are submerged in historic levels of floodwater.</li>
                <li>Urban areas like Mumbai and Bengaluru were lashed with heavy rainfall.</li>
                <li>Mount Abu, got over 50% of its annual rainfall in two days.</li>
                <li>Bengaluru got about 30 per cent of its monsoon rainfall on one day.</li>
                <li>Chandigarh received nearly 15 per cent of its annual rainfall in a few hours.</li>
                <li>The weather patterns during this rainy season where days of severe downpour sandwiched between
                    spells of dry weather, raise questions about our understanding of the monsoon, as well as about the
                    ways in which we prepare for and deal with floods.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Study and Warnings:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A 2013 <strong>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report</strong> warned that <strong>Mumbai
                    remains vulnerable to rainfall</strong> of the kind that led to the 2005 floods.
                </li>
                <li>The <strong>indiscriminate destruction of wetlands</strong> has bargained the city’s capacity to
                    deal with floods which holds true for Bengaluru, Guwahati, and several other cities of the country.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Governance efforts</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Steps taken for the restoration of wetlands at the center of flood control programs remains
                    minimal.
                </li>
                <li>Flood governance in the country has not gone beyond ad hoc relief measures and building
                    embankments.
                </li>
                <li>Thus it’s the need of the hour that we require fresh thinking on how to prepare for the monsoons and
                    deal with floods.

                                <li>Replacing a mutated gene that causes disease with a healthy copy of the gene.</li>

                            inherited disorders, some types of cancer, and certain viral infections), the technique
                            remains risky and is still under study to make sure that it will be safe and effective.

                        <li>Plants in the Bromeliaceae are widely represented in their natural climates across the
                            Americas. One species can be found in Africa. They can be found at altitudes from sea level
                            to 4200 meters, from rainforests to deserts. 1814 species are epiphytes, some are
                            lithophytes, and some are terrestrial. Accordingly, these plants can be found in the Andean
                            highlands, from northern Chile to Colombia, in the Sechura Desert of coastal Peru, in the
                            cloud forests of Central and South America, in southern United States from southern Virginia
                            to Florida to Texas, and in far southern Arizona.

            <p><strong>Topic: CASE STUDY ANALYSIS</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Question 1.</strong></p>
            <p>What is a gene therapy? What are the ethical issues surrounding gene therapy?</p>
            <p><strong>Question 2.</strong></p>
            <p>Recently a peon was appointed in your office (DM office). He is illiterate and mentally not sound. Ever
                since his appointment he has been more of a ‘burden’ than any help in the office. He doesn’t know any
                work. Staff in your office feel that their work is disturbed by his behaviour. The peon is always found
                to be talking either alone or with anyone he encounters. He is not obeying your staff’s orders in the
                office.</p>
            <p>He was appointed on sympathy grounds after his father’s untimely death. His mother is ill and always
                bedridden. His income is the only source for his family now. He got the job after lobbying by a group
                representing his caste. He was appointed by your predecessor after he was pressurized by local MP. Some
                moves to remove him by your predecessor were met with public protests by a group representing his
                caste.</p>
            <p>You are very strict and disciplined in your office. You are being respected in your district for your
                integrity and honesty. You come to know about the peon few days after you assume power. You have
                observed his behavior and found him to be unfit to continue in his job. The peon has no other relatives
                except his mother.</p>
            <p>Identify your moral and professional responsibilities in this case study and explain how will you deal
                with the peon.</p>
            <p><em><strong><span>Answer</span></strong></em></p>
            <p>Since the peon is unfit for the job, the option of continuing him is ruled out. So protection to his
                family should remain the priority of DM.</p>
            <p><strong>Responsibilities of DM:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>social security and health care to peon and his mother</li>
                <li>removing the peon peacefully after pacifying all parties involved</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Course of action to be followed:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Certain actions of peon in the office should be video-recorded such as not heeding to the officers,
                    disturbing others in office etc.
                </li>
                <li>On priority, DM should make an arrangement for social security benefits along with health insurance
                    to peon and his mother. A request for pension should also be made to higher authorities on
                    exceptional grounds.
                </li>
                <li>There after a meeting should be arranged with his caste members to explain the real problem being
                    faced in the office and why he should be removed from the office by showing them video-clips.
                </li>
                <li>At the same time DM should take own responsibility for peon’s pension and other benefits before the
                    members.
                </li>
                <li>Once they agree, his removal would be done in a smooth manner without any controversy.</li>
                <li>In case they do not agree immediately, steps should be taken to constantly persuade the key members
                    of his caste group one-by-one through constant consultations and that would surely resolve the
                    problem.
                </li>
                <li>In doing the above, work culture and discipline in the organisation will be protected but at the
                    same time solved the problems of most vulnerable people i.e. peon and his mother empathetically.
                </li>

                        <p><strong>In news:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To achieve the country’s population control target faster, the government has decided to
                                accelerate family planning measures by identifying 146 districts where the total
                                fertility rate (TFR, the number of children born per woman) is more than three and which
                                add up to 28% of the population.
                            </li>
                            <li>The health ministry is set to roll out <strong>“Mission Parivar Vikas”</strong> in these
                                districts to improve access to family planning services, create awareness and make
                                family planning choices available.
                            </li>
                            <li>The “high-focus” districts are in the seven states of <strong>Uttar Pradesh, Bihar,
                                Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Assam</strong>.
                            </li>
                            <li>Though India’s population growth rate has declined, the pace is uneven across states,
                                leading to the policy intervention.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Key facts:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>According to government data, India’s <strong>total fertility rate </strong>has declined
                                from 2<strong>.6 in 2008</strong> <strong>to 2.3</strong> at present.
                            </li>
                            <li>India is now just 0.2 points away from reaching the replacement level of 2.1.</li>
                            <li>The greater the TFR, the more will be the Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) and Infant
                                Mortality Rate (IMR). Hence, reducing TFR would lead to decrease in maternal mortality
                                and morbidity and infant mortality and morbidity.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Under the mission, the government will study each district to find why fertility rates
                                are higher and will take measures to address them.
                            </li>
                            <li>As part of the programme, the health ministry will distribute a kit containing products
                                of family planning and personal hygiene among newlyweds.
                            </li>
                            <li>The kits will be distributed by ASHA workers to encourage inter-spousal communication
                                and consensual decision making with regards to their reproductive and sexual health as
                                well as delay the birth of the first child and space the second.
                            </li>
                            <li>“Saas-Bahu Sammelans” will be held to facilitate improved communication between
                                mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law and bridge the gap in their attitudes and beliefs
                                about reproductive and sexual health.
                            </li>
                            <li>Special buses called “Saarthi-Awareness on Wheels” will travel through these districts
                                to generate awareness as well as sensitise the community and disseminate family planning
                                messages.
                            </li>
                            <li>The government will also augment sterilisation services through enhanced HFD (high
                                fertility district) compensation scheme, roll out injectable contraceptive at sub centre
                                level and generate awareness about condoms and pills.

                            </li>
                            <li>The <strong>‘One Family at a Time’ </strong>study by the UN International Fund for
                                Agricultural Development (IFAD) said about 200 million migrants globally sent more than
                                USD 445 million in 2016 as remittances to their families, helping to lift millions out

                        <ul>
                            <li>The study is the first-ever of a 10-year trend in migration and remittance flows over
                                the period 2007-2016
                            </li>
                            <li>Remittance flows have grown over the last decade at a rate averaging 4.2 per cent
                                annually
                            </li>
                            <li>It said 80 per cent of remittances are received by 23 countries, led by India, China,
                                the Philippines, Mexico and Pakistan
                            </li>
                            <li>The top 10 sending countries account for almost half of annual flows, led by the US,
                                Saudi Arabia and Russia
                            </li>
                            <li>Asia remains the main remittance-receiving region, with 55 per cent of the global flows
                                and 41 per cent of total migrants
                            </li>
                            <li>Over the past decade, remittances to Asia and the Pacific increased by 87 per cent</li>

                        <p><strong>Remittance and poverty reduction:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The study added that the amount of money migrants send to their families in developing
                                countries has risen by 51 per cent over the past decade
                            </li>
                            <li>This dramatic increase in the amount of money migrants sent home to their families in
                                developing countries is helping to lift millions out of poverty and in attaining the
                                Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)
                            </li>
                            <li>About 40 per cent of remittances – USD 200 billion – are sent to rural areas where the
                                majority of poor people live
                            </li>
                            <li>The money is spent on food, health care, better educational opportunities and improved

                            </li>
                            <li>The small amounts of USD 200 or USD 300 that each migrant sends home make up about 60
                                per cent of the family’s household income, and this makes an enormous difference in
                                their lives and the communities in which they live

                        <ul>
                            <li>Currently, about 200 million migrant workers support some 800 million family members
                                globally
                            </li>
                            <li>In 2017, an expected one-in-seven people globally will be involved in either sending or
                                receiving more than USD 450 billion in remittances
                            </li>
                            <li>Total migrant earnings are estimated at USD 3 trillion annually, approximately 85 per
                                cent of which remains in the host countries
                            </li>
                            <li>The money sent home averages less than one per cent of their host’s GDP</li>
                            <li>Taken together, these individual remittances account for more than three times the
                                combined official development assistance (ODA) from all sources, and more than the total
                                foreign direct investment to almost every low-and middle-income country

                            <li>The widening of the CAD on a year-on-year basis was primarily on account of a higher
                                trade deficit ($29.7 billion) brought about by a larger increase in merchandise imports
                                relative to export.

                        <pre><strong>Basic Information:&#13;
&#13;
</strong>Countries trade with one another to buy goods not produced in domestic economy. With the &#13;
advent of globalization, investment to and fro have also increased many fold. A country’s &#13;
trade and other economic exchanges with the world are recorded on its external account in &#13;
the form of balance of payment (BoP) transactions. &#13;
&#13;
There are two components of BoP&#13;
1. Current Account&#13;
2. Capital Account&#13;
&#13;
<strong>Current Account</strong> – It deals with current, ongoing, short term transactions like&#13;
trade in goods, services (invisible) etc. It reflects the nation’s net income.&#13;
&#13;
For instance, if you a buy a laptop from US, it will be a current account transaction &#13;
and it will be debit on current account as you have to pay to US.&#13;
&#13;
There are 4 components of Current Account-&#13;
1. Goods – trade in goods&#13;
2. Services (invisible) – trade in services eg. tourism&#13;
3. Income – investment income&#13;
4. Current unilateral transfers – donations, gifts, grants, remittances&#13;
&#13;
Note that grants might appear as component of capital account but are included &#13;
in current account as they are unilateral, create no liability. Recipient does &#13;
not have to give anything back in return.&#13;
&#13;
<strong>Capital Account</strong> – It deal with capital transactions i.e. those transactions which&#13;
create assets or liabilities. It reflects the net changes in the ownership of &#13;
national assets.&#13;
&#13;
For instance, if you buy a stocks or property in US, it will be a capital account&#13;
transaction and it will be debit on capital account as you have to pay to US to buy&#13;
the asset.<strong> &#13;
&#13;
</strong><strong>Components of Capital Account&#13;
</strong>Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)&#13;
Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI)&#13;
External Borrowings such as ECB&#13;
Reserve Account with the Central Bank&#13;
&#13;
Note here that foreign investment is under capital account but dividends and &#13;
income from investment comes under current account in the category income from &#13;
abroad as dividend is transferred periodically, does not result in creation of &#13;
asset or liability.&#13;
&#13;
<span>Balance of Payment (BoP) = Current Account + Capital Account = 0&#13;
&#13;
</span><strong>Why?&#13;
</strong>Current Account and Capital Account always balance each other because a country &#13;
always has to pay for its imports. It does so by exports or other two components&#13;
of current account. If it cannot, it runs deficit on current account and has to &#13;
pay off by drawing off on its assets i.e. running capital account surplus.&#13;
&#13;
<strong>What is Current Account Deficit?&#13;
</strong>It’s simply deficit on all 4 components of current account.&#13;
(Export – Import) + Net income from abroad + Net Transfers&#13;
(Export – Import) is trade deficit&#13;
CAD = Trade Deficit + Net Income From Abroad + Net transfers&#13;
&#13;
Note that Trade Deficit and CAD are not one and the same. Trade deficit is only &#13;
a component of CAD.&#13;
&#13;
<strong>What does deficit on Current Account imply?&#13;
</strong>If we forget income and transfers for a moment, what it means is that we import &#13;
more than what we export.&#13;
&#13;
<strong>How do we pay for that extra import?&#13;
</strong>Either we get more foreign investment (FDI &amp; FII) and pay via that or we borrow from &#13;
foreign banks (ECB) or we will have to dip into our external reserves to pay for that&#13;
Amount and in the process our forex reserves come down. When forex reserves come down &#13;
below a critical level, country appears on the brink of BoP crisis.&#13;
&#13;
<strong>So, is CAD such a bad thing?&#13;
</strong>Depends on what you do with those extra imports and how you finance the deficit!&#13;
&#13;
<strong>CAD is bad because –&#13;
</strong>If a CAD is financed through borrowing, it is unsustainable because borrowing &#13;
lead to high interest payments in the future&#13;
Attracting capital flows (hot money, FII) to finance the deficit is risky as when &#13;
confidence falls, hot money flows dry up, leading to a rapid devaluation and crisis&#13;
of confidence. Eg. East Asian Crisis&#13;
Run a CAD necessarily means running a surplus on the capital account. This means &#13;
foreigners have an increasing claim on your assets, which they could redeem any time.&#13;
&#13;
<strong>However a current account deficit is not necessarily harmful&#13;
</strong>CAD during a period of inward investment particularly stable long term FDI may &#13;
not be a bad things as investment can create jobs. Investments will lead to &#13;
higher growth will be able to pay debts back.&#13;
Developing countries may use CAD to buy Capital goods and later export consumer &#13;
goods and thus repay the debt&#13;
Moderate current account deficit (2% of GDP) financed mainly by stable foreign &#13;
investments which creates jobs and infrastructure in the economy can be helpful &#13;
in the long run as it improves productivity.<strong> &#13;
&#13;
</strong><strong>What is this twin deficit?&#13;
</strong>Current Account Deficit and Fiscal Deficit together are knows as twin deficits &#13;
and often both reinforce each other i.e. High fiscal deficit leads to higher CAD&#13;
and vice versa.</pre>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>The TIR Convention establishes an international customs transit system with
                                        maximum facility to move goods:
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>In sealed vehicles or containers;</p>
                                <p>From a customs office of departure in one country to a customs office of destination
                                    in another country;</p>
                                <p>Without requiring extensive and time-consuming border checks at intermediate
                                    borders;</p>
                                <p>While, at the same time, providing customs authorities with the required security and
                                    guarantees.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The TIR system not only covers customs transit by road but a combination is
                                        possible with other modes of transport (e.g., rail, inland waterway, and even
                                        maritime transport), as long as at least one part of the total transport is made
                                        by road.
                                    </li>

            <p><strong>Context:</strong> Supreme Court Ruling on the issue of triple talaq, which questions the women
                dignity.</p>
            <p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The largest percentage of divorces takes place among Muslim women. Stats say that the majority is n
                    the age group 20-34 (43.9%), in which only 24% of the total Muslim female population lies.
                </li>
                <li>Recently the five-judge Bench of the Supreme Court verdict that struck down instant triple talaq
                    describes the social context.
                </li>
                <li>The rate of divorce was significantly lower among men than among women, as per the Census data of
                    India, 2011.
                </li>
                <li>But the disparity was particularly stark among Muslims where the “refined divorce rate”, or rate of
                    divorce per 1,000 marriages, was 1.59 among Muslim men, among Muslim women, it was more than three
                    and a half times higher — 5.63.
                </li>
                <li>Buddhists came next on the disparity scale, followed by Christians.</li>
                <li>On a broad view, the number of divorces per 1,000 marriages in India are 1.58 for men, and for
                    women, double that at 3.10.
                </li>
                <li>But with respect to the duration of staying divorced as per the Census data, men tend to re-marry at
                    a far quicker rate than women.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Supreme Court verdict striking down <strong>talaq-e-biddat or instant triple talaq</strong> has been
                    rightly hailed as a victory for gender justice.
                </li>
                <li>But bringing it to the notice, there are no concrete data on the prevalence of this form of divorce
                    thus the impact of the judgment is difficult to measure.
                </li>
                <li>Muslim couples have several other ways to divorce including the intervention of religious
                    institutions such as the Qazi and Dar-ul-Qaza.
                </li>
                <li>The definitive assessment shows that the social, educational and economic backwardness and
                    deprivation status of Muslims women is both the reason and consequence of such social evils.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Legal provision to settle the cases of Divorce</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Divorce Act, 1869 (4 of 1869),</li>
                <li>The Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936 (3 of 1936),</li>
                <li>The Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939 (8 of 1939),</li>
                <li>The Special Marriage Act, 1954 (43 of 1954), and</li>
                <li>The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.</li>

                <li>A bunch of petitions were filed in the Supreme Court in 2015 challenging Aadhaar as a <strong>breach
                    of privacy, informational self-determination and bodily integrity.</strong></li>
                <li>A <strong>nine-judge Constitution Bench</strong> of the Supreme Court, is all set to deliver the
                    judgment on the question: <strong>whether right to privacy of citizens is a fundamental right under
                        the Constitution?</strong></li>

                <li><strong>International legal framework which speaks about Right to Privacy:</strong>

                            1948</strong> and <strong>Article 17</strong> of the <strong>International Covenant on Civil
                            and Political Rights (ICCPR), 1966</strong>, both legally protect persons against the
                            “<strong>arbitrary interference</strong>” with one’s privacy, family, home, correspondence,

                <li><strong>Petitioner’s argument in Aadhaar case:</strong> Aadhaar enrollment is the means to a

            <p><strong>Apprehension expressed by the Supreme Court:  </strong>collection and use of data is the risk of

                <li>The nationwide ban on sale of liquor within a distance of 500 metres along National and State
                    Highways <strong>does not extend to municipal areas (</strong>does not prohibit licensed

                            ban.

                            governments or local authorities.

            <ul>
                <li>Saudization or Saudisation of the workforce—the replacement of foreign workers with Saudi nationals
                    in the private sector—is the official national policy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
                </li>
                <li>This new revised scheme is a blow to Indian migrants.</li>
                <li>The Nitaqat system was first introduced in mid-2011 to encourage employment of Saudi nationals.</li>
                <li>Employers are divided into four categories, Platinum, Green (with three sub categories of high,
                    medium and low), Yellow and Red. Those in Platinum have a higher proportion of Saudi nationals as
                    employees
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>New revised rules and its impact</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>From September 2017, only a handful of organisations with high grades (‘Platinum’ and ‘High Green’
                    categories) — based on number of Saudi nationals employed by them and other criteria — will be able
                    to apply for new block visas for migrant employees.
                </li>
                <li>Construction and hospitality, sectors which falls under low category have a predominantly blue
                    collar Indian workforce, are unlikely to gain from such rules. Workers already employed in companies
                    falling in low categories cannot be transferred from one employer to another.

                <li>There is an opportunity for India in President Donald Trump’s new assertive policy but skeptics in
                    Delhi are doubtful if Washington has the political will to carry through the promised pressure on
                    Pakistan to stop hosting terror sanctuaries on its soil.
                </li>
                <li>India with respect to Afghanistan ought to do more despite its significant efforts in the past to
                    promote economic reconstruction in Afghanistan.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Shift in Washington’s thinking</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Bush Administration’s- was expansive towards India in the Afghan strategy but cautioned against
                    too large a role in Afghanistan.
                </li>
                <li>It invested enormous political capital in getting the world to lift a four decades-old nuclear
                    blockade (Pakistan) against Delhi.
                </li>
                <li>The Obama Administration began with the intention that the answer to Afghanistan is in promoting a
                    resolution of Pakistan’s Kashmir dispute with India.
                </li>
                <li>Consequently Indian diplomacy must necessarily keep its eyes open for a return of these familiar
                    themes in the US approach to Pakistan.
                </li>
                <li>Therefore positive Indian diplomatic approach should involve economic, security and diplomatic
                    elements.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Role of Pakistan</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Despite the China card against the US, Pakistan is highly conscious of the dangers of being treated
                    as a rogue state by the West.
                </li>
                <li>Pakistan displays dead silence in response to the Trump speech which suggests that Rawalpindi has
                    chosen to avoid a public argument with Washington.
                </li>
                <li>The Pakistan Army will try and find ways to counter Trump’s New South Asian Policy but it will not
                    be easy for Pakistan to abandon its investments in cross-border terror.
                </li>
                <li>Only gate presently open for Rawalpindi is to offer some cooperation in countering terror and make
                    new promises to bring the Taliban to the table.
                </li>
                <li>But it will urge US pressure on India to start talks on Kashmir at the backend.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>India- Afghan Bilateral Relationship</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>India should essentially ramp up its economic diplomacy in Afghanistan to bring immediate benefits
                    to Kabul amongst the deteriorating conditions in the country. Delhi must step up security
                    cooperation with Afghanistan.
                </li>
                <li>India must offer training of its police and armed forces and intelligence sharing.</li>
                <li>On the diplomatic front, India must counter the emerging argument that Trump’s new approach will
                    intensify the “Indo-Pak rivalry” in Afghanistan and the old one that Kashmir holds the key to peace
                    in Afghanistan.
                </li>
                <li>Prime Minister Narendra Modi had articulated this vision in an address to the Afghan parliament that
                    Delhi must remind the world of India’s commitment to regional cooperation with Afghanistan and
                    Pakistan, in an atmosphere free of terrorism.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Way forward</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Trump’s new Afghan strategy could be a potential game-changer for South Asia or a brief exception to
                    the familiar pattern of US-Pak relations.
                </li>
                <li>While comprehending the potential shadow between Trump’s words and deeds, Delhi needs to activate
                    its own activism to stimulate positive outcomes in Afghanistan.
                </li>

            <p><strong>Context:</strong> Nepal’s Prime Minister, Sher Bahadur Deuba to visit India.</p>
            <p><strong>Key points</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Nepal’s PM Deuba’s five-day visit to be seen as an opportunity for India to take a relook on the
                    diplomatic ties between the countries.
                </li>
                <li>Nepal-India relations have been sinusoidal for decades, however the two Modi visits did not help in
                    restoration.
                </li>
                <li>India continues to be seen in Nepal as the interfering Big Brother, who “micromanages” the country’s
                    politics and installs puppet governments.
                </li>
                <li>If anything, anti-India sentiment was strengthened by the The 2015 Great Blockade by the Madhesis
                    was seen to have Delhi’s tacit support and the end result was strengthening of anti India sentiment.
                    The quest of their demand lies in greater representation in the Nepal Parliament.
                </li>
                <li>But then China poured money into Nepal for several infrastructure projects, and sewed up trade and
                    transit deals during the same period.
                </li>
                <li>Secondly, the Mahakali Multipurpose Project Daube signed when he was PM in 1996 but no progress seen
                    till present.
                </li>
                <li>Thirdly the consequences of the November 2016 demonetization also impacted Nepali traders and
                    businessmen.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Way forward</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>New Delhi should comfort Deuba’s first foreign visit.</li>
                <li>MoUs and other agreements to be signed should project that India is a friend, even in the absence of
                    China.
                </li>
                <li>India’s challenge will be to persuade both the premier and Nepal that India can really keep out of
                    the country’s internal affairs.

            <ul>
                <li>Cabinet decision regarding constitution of an alternative mechanism is an important first step

                </li>

            <p><strong>Context:</strong> GST avoids the challenge of shifting to a higher proportion of direct taxe</p>
            <p><strong>Key points</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sustainability of taxation policy is an echo of economic policy. Thus GST has to be weighed upon a
                    broader taxation policy perspective.
                </li>
                <li>India’s tax-GDP ratio is at 18 per cent, which when compared with developed countries (between 30
                    per cent and 40 per cent) as well as comparable economies such as Mexico, Brazil, and South Africa
                    (between 23 per cent and 26 per cent) the picture looks grim. Therefore India should target to reach
                    25 per cent.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Reasons</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Of the total taxes collected in India, almost two-thirds come from indirect taxes while taxes on
                    income and profits contribute only a one-third share.
                </li>
                <li>But the scenario is exactly in opposite proportion when compared to other nations.</li>
                <li>In a country with strong economic progress as well as social policy goals, such an abysmal base of
                    direct taxes and a excessive proportion of indirect taxes is the way for an hostile future.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong> GST Analysis</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Under reporting of turnover and evasion of taxes on goods and services is the first step towards
                    evasion of taxes on profits and income.
                </li>
                <li>With the junction of direct and indirect tax departments and also owing to the conception of
                    non-erasable automated electronic trails by GST, it is seen as an near impossible task for the
                    business class to default on direct taxes.
                </li>
                <li>GST pushes every firm to be a registered and tax compliant business unit rather than remain an
                    unregistered seller due to the peculiar system of tax input credit.
                </li>
                <li>Despite great potential, the choices with respect to tax rates and the segregations made by the GST
                    council are bringing the graph down rather than promising. India’s GST rate is broken down into four
                    rates — 5, 12, 18, and 28 per cent but the reality shows that at least seven rates would be in
                    operation.
                </li>
                <li>This would defy the objective of “one nation one tax” and also increase the possibility of
                    corruption and falsification due to a multiple-slab, loophole-prone tax system.
                </li>
                <li>Certain items such as petroleum, electricity and taxes on liquor, which constitute a major chunk of
                    states’ income, are kept away from the purview of the GST.
                </li>
                <li>The exclusion of the petroleum sector from GST, which contributed, for a raise in tax collection by
                    122% over past three years is a mockery of justice.
                </li>
                <li>Due to lack of infrastructural preparedness, there could be a temporary obstruction in small and
                    medium businesses.
                </li>

                <p><strong>Topic: CASE STUDY ANALYSIS</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Question 1. </strong> You are running a Non Governmental Organization to educate orphans,
                    beggars and other single/lonely child. Appreciating the work, Government of India sanctions a grant
                    of Rs. 2 lakhs/year lapsable fund. But due to your commitment towards Civil service examination, you
                    could only spend Rs. 50,000/- this year. A friend advises you not to return the remaining amount as
                    it would result in labeling the NGO as inefficient and reduce the grant for next year. S/he also
                    suggests you to manipulate the accounts and use the remaining Rs.1, 50,000/- along with the next
                    year’s grant without misusing the purpose of the grant. So what is your stand?</p>
                <p><em><strong>Answer</strong></em></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>NGO is a helping hand to the government for the welfare of the society. It should be a
                        non-competitive, non-profitable organization. In this case study the personal values of Honesty
                        versus Self Interest are tested.
                    </li>
                    <li>A right is always correct even if nobody is following and a wrong is always wrong even if
                        everyone is following. Therefore a second wrong can never correct the first wrong.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Points on a stand to return the unused grant</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>First mistake can be the reason behind further wrongs like corruption, inefficiency, inability,
                        and manipulations.
                    </li>
                    <li>It questions the professional integrity and human values.</li>
                    <li>Furthermore inner conscience which is a higher court of justice which supersedes all other
                        courts (M K Gandhi) would kill the values and objectives of past achievements.
                    </li>
                    <li>The honest step to return the unutilized grant can increase the trust and credibility of the
                        organization, which can result in attracting more donors.
                    </li>
                    <li>Keeping apart the human values, it is the duty of a citizen to follow the law of the land to
                        keep up the spirit of Mahatma Gandhi’s ideology – “means are equally important as ends”.
                    </li>
                    <li>On the other hand the act of manipulation is a form of corruption, which has potential to
                        derecognize legally and defame the organization socially.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Points in favor of friend’s opinion</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Intention to manipulate the accounts was not for self-benefits. Hence there is no misuse in the
                        objective or resources.
                    </li>
                    <li>This move can bring about a larger outcome (Utilitarian concept- the doctrine that an action is
                        right in so far as it promotes happiness, and that the greatest happiness of the greatest number
                        should be the guiding principle of conduct.)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Looking into the positives and negatives of the move I would decide to return the grant along
                        with a statement of the organization’s expenditure and future course of action. So that
                        Government of India could take a call on the future grants.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <li>The government could consider introducing a new law to ensure transparency of rules.</li>
                <li><strong>Present problems faced by citizens</strong>: it is not easy for ordinary citizens [and
                    businesses] in India to navigate the multitude of rules, regulations, forms, taxes and procedures
                    imposed by various tiers of government. Moreover, these rules frequently change and sometimes
                    contradict each other

                <li><strong>Transparency of Rules Act (TORA)</strong>– recommended by the Economic Survey, stressing
                    that the ‘opaque mesh’ of regulations prevalent in India not only make life difficult for citizens
                    who cannot feign ignorance of the rules as a valid defence, but also act as a magnet for corruption
                    and endless litigation.
                </li>
                <li>The TORA is an attempt to change in some ways the relationship between the average normal citizen

            <li>More liberal norms that will allow live-in couples, divorced women, and widows to choose surrogates is
                the need of the hour
            </li>

            <li>It criticized the exclusion of live-in partners from the ambit of the legislation</li>
            <li>According to the panel, the bill talks about compensation rather than altruism as the guiding principle
                of surrogacy, the panel finds this anti-women

                <li>The government’s reply last month to the Supreme Court, saying that the questions raised in a
                    petition challenging Article 35A require a larger debate
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What is Article 35A?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It was added by a 1954 presidential order issued under Article 370, the constitutional provision
                    that mediates the relationship between the Union of India and Kashmir
                </li>
                <li>Article 35A of the Indian Constitution is an article that empowers the Jammu and Kashmir state’s
                    legislature to define “permanent residents” of the state and provide special rights and privileges
                    to those permanent residents.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Who is a permanent resident?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The 1956 J&amp;K Constitution defines a Permanent Resident as one who, apart from being an Indian
                    citizen, was a state subject on May 14, 1954, or a resident of the state for 10 years, and owns
                    immovable property in the state.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Apprehensions</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Government’s new legal pro-activism against Articles 35A or 370 will lead to more alienation in the
                    Valley.
                </li>
                <li>In the Valley, the government’s reply on 35A is being seen as paving the way for moves to do away
                    with Article 370 that excludes J&amp;K from most laws enacted by Parliament, except through
                    presidential orders that have the concurrence of the J&amp;K Legislative Assembly
                </li>
                <li>Court has also asked the Centre to respond to a petition challenging Article 370.</li>
                <li>All this has served to strengthen suspicions that the Centre is using the legal route to bring about
                    the changes that it wants

            <p><strong>Air pollution menace</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>WHO reports that air pollution is the number one environmental health risk. In 2012, about 3 million
                    premature deaths were attributable to ambient air pollution.
                </li>
                <li>Children are most affected by air pollution and will be the primary beneficiaries of policies to
                    reduce fossil fuel emissions.
                </li>
                <li>Research has also established links between public health and a nation’s economic growth.</li>
                <li>Joint study by the World Bank and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation found that the
                    aggregate cost of premature deaths due to air pollution was more than $5 trillion worldwide in 2013
                    alone.
                </li>
                <li>In East and South Asia, welfare losses related to air pollution were about 7.5% of GDP.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>WHO’s  Health Indicators of Sustainable Energy</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It lays out a few core and expanded indicators that can help monitor the progress of a nation’s
                    energy policy.
                </li>
                <li>The core indicators address issues related to health equity where health impact assessments become
                    an integral part of energy policy design and implementation.
                </li>
                <li>It stress on the need to develop baseline data by generating emission inventories and source
                    apportionment of urban air pollution that can inform mitigation and intervention policies.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Way forward</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>National Energy Policy have to strive to minimise the unavoidable health impacts of energy
                    production, and their associated health costs, especially given the policy’s stated objectives of
                    sustainability and economic growth.
                </li>
                <li>It should include a health impact assessment framework to weigh the health hazards and health costs

                <li>The Indian economy’s growth in 2017-18 is more likely to be closer to 6.5% than 7.5%, according to
                    Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian.

                <li>Many indicators — credit growth, index of industrial production, Gross Value Added, manufacturing,
                    investment – all point to the same direction of deceleration in growth.

                <li><strong>Demonetisation impact:</strong> demonetisation of high-value currency notes by the

                <li>Large increase in capacity entitlements under bilateral air service agreements with foreign
                    countries has helped the foreign carriers in gaining a large share in the international traffic to
                    and from India as the domestic carriers have underutilised their rights.
                </li>

            <p><strong>Key fact:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Roughly 38% people fly in and out of India through Indian carriers and the rest 62% from foreign

                    of passenger traffic to and from India.
                </li>
                <li>These countries were invariably used as stop-overs or hubs by their respective airlines to carry
                    passengers onward to USA, Canada, Europe, among others.
                </li>
                <li>Indian domestic airlines have a very lower share in international traffic to and from India.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Factors responsible</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Foreign airlines utilising the sixth freedom of the air</li>
                <li>Expansion of capacity entitlements under bilateral air service agreements with foreign countries
                </li>
                <li>Lower utilisation of India’s own capacity entitlements</li>
                <li>The 0/20 rule and fleet constraints.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>What is Sixth freedom?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sixth freedom is the bilateral air traffic right to fly from a foreign country to another foreign
                    country while stopping in one’s own country.
                </li>
                <li>For instance, Emirates operates flight between India and the UK while stopping at Dubai, its home
                    state.
                </li>
                <li>The Survey said this has reduced the share of direct long haul flights for Indian carriers from 25%
                    in 2011-12 to 20.5% in 2015-16.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>0/20 rule</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A domestic airline needs to deploy at least 20 planes on the domestic sector before getting the
                    right to fly on international routes from India.
                </li>
                <li>The Economic Survey said the 0/20 rule should be further diluted.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Diluted 5/20 rule</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>In its <strong>National Civil Aviation Policy</strong> released in 2016, the Central government had
                    diluted the contentious ‘5/20 rule’ that required an Indian airline to have five years of domestic
                    flying experience and 20 aircraft in its fleet before it can fly to overseas destinations.
                </li>
                <li>According to the present norm, known as the 0/20 rule, a domestic airline needs to deploy at least
                    20 planes on the domestic sector before getting the right to fly on international routes from India.
                    The Economic Survey said the 0/20 rule should be further diluted.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Air India’s disinvestment plans</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>According to the survey Air India’s disinvestment will also help India regain international share.
                </li>
                <li>There is a need for committed action plan on privatization or disinvestment of national carrier Air
                    India to enhance its operational and management efficiency because it is a major carrier of
                    international traffic to and from India, accounting for 11.4 per cent of the total international
                    travel.

            <p><strong>In news</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Economic Survey assumes that other States will follow Uttar Pradesh’s example and waive farm
                    loans, taking the full waiver amount to ₹2-2.7 lakh crore.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Survey Observations</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Only a few States have the fiscal space for such waivers, and so most will have to either cut
                    expenditure or increase taxes.
                </li>
                <li>The total impact of waivers could be to lower demand by as much as 0.7% of the GDP.</li>
                <li><strong>Increase the net wealth of farm households</strong>: loan waivers are assumed to increase
                    aggregate income by 28%, consumption is estimated to increase by 7% or about ₹55,000 crore.
                </li>
                <li>Andhra Pradesh, U.P, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Odisha, and Chhattisgarh have no fiscal
                    room to waive farm loans, States such as Maharashtra, West Begal, Karnataka and Gujarat have ample
                    space.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Waiver and the Four effects</strong></p>
            <p>The Survey says the waivers will have four effects on aggregate demand:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>On private consumption impact via increases in private sector net wealth,</li>
                <li>Public sector impact via changes in government expenditure/taxes,</li>
                <li>Crowding out impact via higher borrowings by State governments, and</li>
                <li>Crowding in impact via higher credit availability as bank NPAs fall.</li>

            <p><strong>For Example</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A sample of ‘organic’ labelled green capsicum purchased on June 16, 2017 from a prominent
                    hypermarket in Ernakulam was found contaminated, with the presence of seven chemical pesticides
                    including five insecticides: acetamiprid (1.12 parts per million), clothianidin (0.72 ppm),
                    imidacloprid (0.69 ppm), buprofezin (0.12 ppm), acephate (1.78 ppm) and two fungicides, tebuconazole
                    (0.84 ppm ) and iprovalicarb (0.22 ppm).

                            fish is a regular catch for fishermen in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. It is a colourful
                            fish which is around 97mm in length and lives near the reefs. The researchers stated that
                            this fish has a unique colour pattern with spectacular diamond shaped bands. Reportedly, it
                            is the only fifth fish in this category of size. Now, the tiny colourful fish will have the

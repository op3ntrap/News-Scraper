                    </li>
                    <li>The two countries, especially India’s Northeast, stand to gain enormously from closer road and

                    </li>

                    <li>In 2008, rail links disrupted by hostility with erstwhile East Pakistan were reestablished, the
                        375 km route crossing the border at Gede on the Indian side and Darshana on the Bangladesh side

                <ul>
                    <li>A line links Siliguri in North Bengal to Parbatipur in northern Bangladesh, by which India sent
                        a 42-wagon consignment of high speed diesel manufactured by Numaligarh Refinery in Assam in
                        March 2017
                    </li>
                    <li>But there is no regular goods train movement on this route, and passenger services are unlikely
                        soon
                    </li>
                    <li>Because of trans-border crimes and infiltration in the North Bengal sector</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Kolkata-Dibrugarh waterway through Dhaka and Guwahati, started in 1844 by the East India Company
                        and shut after the 1965 war, was recently reopened
                    </li>
                    <li>Heavy machinery and equipment for the Numaligarh refinery and Lower Subansiri hydroelectric
                        project in Arunachal Pradesh have been transported by this route
                    </li>

                <p>Road Transport</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In November 2015, seamless road cargo transport between Kolkata and Agartala through Bangladesh
                        was tried out successfully under the Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal (BBIN) Motor Vehicles
                        Agreement (MVA)
                    </li>
                    <li>Regular services are yet to start</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Northeast: the biggest beneficiary </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The creation of East Pakistan — and subsequently, Bangladesh — significantly increased the
                        distance between the Northeast and the Indian mainland
                    </li>
                    <li>Until 1947, a train to Guwahati from Kolkata took hardly 12 hours</li>
                    <li>Today, despite increased speeds, the journey takes at least 18 hours by the fastest train, while
                        a normal train — such as the Kamrup Express — takes almost 24 hours through Siliguri or New
                        Jalpaiguri.
                    </li>
                    <li>Before Partition, people travelled from Guwahati to Kolkata via Lalmonirhat, in the Bangladesh
                        district close to where the Brahmaputra crosses the border
                    </li>
                    <li>Trains between Assam and Kolkata through East Pakistan stopped in 1947; trains between West
                        Bengal and East Pakistan stopped after the 1965 war

                        contemptuous”, observed one of the judges hearing petitions by the Campaign for Judicial
                        Accountability and Reforms and advocate Kamini Jaiswal in the Supreme Court in the medical
                        college bribery case. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Justice Mishra is part of a Special Bench led by Justice R.K. Agrawal, and also comprising
                        Justice A.M. Khanwilkar, which heard Ms. Jaiswal’s petition for an SIT investigation into an
                        alleged conspiracy to bribe Supreme Court judges for a favourable outcome in a pending case of a
                        debarred private medical college. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Responding to Justice Mishra’s remarks that the petitions were scurrilous, Mr. Prashant Bhushan
                        submitted that the petitions do not name the CJI at all.
                    </li>
                    <li>The purpose of the petitions was to protect the independence of the highest judiciary as the
                        bribery was probed by a government-controlled agency, namely, the CBI.

                                        militant commanders that have resulted in a drop in stone-pelting incidents.

                                    <p><strong>Explanation</strong> </p>
                                    <p>Cyclical unemployment is unemployment that results when the overall demand for
                                        goods and services in an economy cannot support full employment. It occurs
                                        during periods of slow economic growth or during periods of economic
                                        contraction.<br/>
                                        Frictional unemployment is always present in the economy, resulting from
                                        temporary transitions made by workers and employers or from workers and
                                        employers having inconsistent or incomplete information. For example, a
                                        first-time job seeker may lack the resources or efficiency for finding the
                                        company that has the job that is available and suitable for him and as a result
                                        does not take other work, temporarily holding out for the better-paying job.
                                        Another example of when frictional employment occurs is when a company abstains
                                        from hiring because it believes there are not enough qualified individuals
                                        available for the job, when in actuality there is.</p></div>

                                    <p><strong>Explanation</strong> </p>
                                    <p>The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) is an index for India which details out
                                        the growth of various sectors in an economy such as mining, electricity and
                                        manufacturing. The all India IIP is a composite indicator that measures the
                                        short-term changes in the volume of production of a basket of industrial
                                        products during a given period with respect to that in a chosen base period. It
                                        is compiled and published monthly by the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO)
                                        six weeks after the reference month ends.<br/>
                                        The level of the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) is an abstract number, the
                                        magnitude of which represents the status of production in the industrial sector
                                        for a given period of time as compared to a reference period of time. The base
                                        year was at one time fixed at 1993–94 so that year was assigned an index level
                                        of 100. The current base year is 2004-05.<br/>
                                        The Eight Core Industries comprise nearly 38 % of the weight of items included
                                        in the Index of Industrial Production (IIP). These are Electricity , steel,
                                        refinery products, crude oil, coal, cement, natural gas and fertilisers.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The Supreme Court on Friday sent a clear message to the public to not panic, by directing mobile
                        service providers and banks to specify the last dates for linking mobile numbers and bank
                        accounts to Aadhaar in the SMSs and e-mails they send to millions of subscribers.
                    </li>

                        for public welfare schemes “constrict rights and freedoms which a citizen has long been enjoying
                        unless and until they part with their personal biometric information to the government”.

                    <li>Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked the private sector to invest more in contract farming, raw
                        material-sourcing and creating agri-linkages.
                    </li>
                    <li>He also pointed out that there are huge opportunities for global super-market chains considering
                        India as a major outsourcing hub.
                    </li>
                    <li>Besides, he suggested that aerated drinks manufacturers consider blending 5% fruit juice in
                        their products, and said such a procedure has major potential since fruit-juice based drinks are
                        an intrinsic part of Indian food habits.
                    </li>
                    <li>In addition, he pitched for a venture based on ‘nutrition-rich and climate-smart crops’ to boost
                        production and supply of India’s coarse grains and millets that ‘not only have high nutritional
                        value, but can also withstand adverse agro-climatic conditions’.

                        <p>Iltutmish introduced Silver Tanka and Copper Jital , the two coins of the Delhi Sultanate.
                            The coins prior to Iltutmish were introduced by the invaders which bear the Sanskrit
                            characters and even Bull and Shivalinga. Iltutmish was the first to introduce a “Pure Arabic
                            Coin” in India. The Coins were engraved with “The Mighty Sultan, Sun of the Empire and the
                            Faith, Conquest-laden, Il-tutmish,” after he received an investiture of Sovereign Sultan of
                            Delhi from the Caliph of Baghdad. The Silver Tanka issued by Iltutmish was weighing 175
                            grains. Gold Tanka of the same weight was later issued by Balban.</p></div>

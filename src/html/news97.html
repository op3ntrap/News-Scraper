                <li>India is planning to have a water grid with the aim of ensuring no area of the country faces any
                    water deficit.
                </li>
                <li>The concept of water grid in India mainly centres around the <strong>existing inter-linking of
                    rivers (ILR) plan</strong> which was conceived in order to <strong>transfer water from surplus zones
                    to deficit zones via inter-connected rivers.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Present focus:</strong> linking three ILR projects – <strong>Ken-Betwa link (Uttar Pradesh
                    and Madhya Pradesh), Par-Tapi-Narmada and Damanganga-Pinjal links (Gujarat and
                    Maharashtra).</strong></li>

                <li>The Supreme Court has asked Google, Microsoft, Facebook and WhatsApp to provide the number of
                    complaints received from India of any objectionable material posted online on their sites between
                    the period of January 1, 2016 and August 31, 2017.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Why?</strong> The court wanted to know whether the online giants had taken any action on the
                    complaints received from India on materials like videos or pictures of child pornography, rape and
                    gangrape, uploaded on their sites.
                </li>
                <li>Supreme Court further asked <strong>the Ministry of Home Affairs</strong> to respond to whether any
                    prosecutions were initiated under the <strong>Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act of
                        2012.</strong> The court wanted to know the number of prosecutions initiated under Sections 19
                    and 21 of the Act between January 1, 2016 to August 31, 2017.

                    <p><strong>The Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act 2012</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Act seeks to protect children from offences such as sexual assault, sexual harassment
                            and pornography. India is a signatory to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child since
                            1992. The parties to the Convention are required to take measures to prevent children from
                            being coerced into any unlawful sexual activity.
                        </li>
                        <li>Any person below the age of 18 years is defined as a “child”. The Act seeks to penalise any
                            person who commits offences such as “sexual harassment”, “sexual assault”, “penetrative
                            sexual assault”, and “aggravated penetrative sexual assault”.
                        </li>
                        <li>A person commits “sexual harassment” if he uses words or shows body parts to a child with
                            sexual intent, shows pornography to a child or threatens to depict a child involved in
                            sexual act through the media. The penalty is imprisonment for upto three years and a fine.
                        </li>
                        <li>A person commits “penetrative sexual assault” if he penetrates his penis into the vagina,
                            mouth, urethra or anus of a child or makes a child do the same or inserts any other object
                            into the child’s body or applies his mouth to a child’s body parts. If however the child is
                            between 16 and 18 years, it shall be considered whether consent for the act was taken
                            against his will or was taken by drugs, impersonation, fraud, undue influence and when the
                            child was sleeping or unconscious. The penalty is imprisonment between seven years and life
                            and a fine.
                        </li>
                        <li>The Act penalises “aggravated penetrative sexual assault.” Such an offence is committed when
                            a police officer, a member of the armed forces or a public servant commits penetrative
                            sexual assault on a child. It also includes gang penetrative sexual assault and assault
                            using deadly weapons, fire or corrosive substance. The Act also covers assault by staff of
                            private hospital and staff of an educational institution if the child is in that
                            institution.
                        </li>
                        <li>Penetrative sexual assault shall be considered aggravated if it injures the sexual organs of
                            the child or takes place during communal violence or the child becomes pregnant or gets any
                            other threatening disease or is below 12 years. It also covers cases where the offender is a
                            relative of the child through blood or adoption or marriage or foster care or is living in
                            the same household.
                        </li>
                        <li>A person commits “sexual assault” if he touches the vagina, penis, anus or breast of a child
                            with sexual intent without penetration. If the child is between 16 and 18 years, it shall be
                            considered whether the consent was taken against the child’s will or by threat or deceit.
                            The penalty is imprisonment between three to five years and a fine.
                        </li>
                        <li>The offence of “aggravated sexual assault” is committed under similar conditions as for
                            “aggravated penetrative sexual assault”. The penalty for the offence is
                        </li>
                        <li>Imprisonment between five to seven years and a fine.</li>
                        <li>A person shall be guilty of using a child for pornographic purposes if he uses a child in
                            any form of media for the purpose of sexual gratification through representation of sexual
                            organs of a child or using a child in sexual acts or other types of obscene representation.
                            The penalty is rigorous imprisonment for upto five years and a fine. On
                        </li>
                        <li>subsequent convictions, the term of imprisonment is upto 7 years and fine.</li>
                        <li>The Act also includes penalties for storage of pornographic material and abetment of an
                            offence.
                        </li>
                        <li>An offence committed under this Act shall be reported to either the local police or the
                            Special Juvenile Police Unit who has to report the matter to the Special Court within 24
                            hours. The police also have to make special arrangement for the care of the child. In case a
                            person fails to report acase, he shall be penalised. Also, the Act includes penalties for
                            making false complaints.

            <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>In April, the government of India proposed <strong>amendments to the RTI Act</strong></li>
                <li>The most controversial amendment pertained to <strong>Rule 12</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Amendment to Rule 12 and controversy:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It would allow the <strong>withdrawal of an application</strong> in case of the applicant’s death,
                    making the job of those who file RTIs even more risky.
                </li>
                <li>The RTI activists are already exposed to violence, all the more so as the Whistle Blowers Protection
                    Act (2011) is not implemented.
                </li>
                <li>69 activists have been killed, according to the National Campaign for People’s Right to
                    Information
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Violence against RTI Activists</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The states which have largest number of casualties are rich states such as <strong>Maharashtra,
                    Gujarat and Karnataka</strong></li>
                <li>Rich states are the most dangerous ones for RTI activists because they fight against the
                    appropriation of public goods by predatory and vested interests, which are comparatively stronger in
                    affluent provinces.
                </li>
                <li>Problems pertaining to land, illegal construction and property disputes are the root cause of most
                    of the cases.
                </li>
                <li>Then come conflicts due to government schemes (including MGNREGA), either because those who should
                    have benefitted from them have not, or because of embezzlement at the local level.
                </li>
                <li>The third category that is also well represented is made of illegal mining, including the sand
                    mafia’s activities.
                </li>
                <li>The RTI activists fight for their rights and/or those of others, but they are hardly protected by
                    the police and judiciary.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong> RTI Activists – Importance</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>RTI applications cover a wide range of issues and even if no action is taken, the media often
                    publicize the cases and give bad publicity to the offending bureaucrats, industrialists or
                    politicians.
                </li>
                <li>The RTI activists not only expose corrupt practices and crimes, but also provide alternative
                    leadership at the local level.
                </li>
                <li>Some of them have become community mobilisers and have been elected sarpanch.</li>
                <li>The RTI Act has offered space to young Dalits, Adivasis and members of the minorities who would have
                    been helpless otherwise.
                </li>
                <li>The role of “RTI clinics”, often in the form of itinerant vans and helplines, has been key.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges faced by RTI Activists:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Information Commissions</strong> are burdened with huge pendencies</li>
                <li>The number of applications filed could easily decrease: If the frequently asked questions were
                    identified and proactively disclose information for those questions
                </li>
                <li>But delays and backlogs are also due to the fact that the job of Information Commissioner has become
                    a post-retirement sinecure for former bureaucrats who do not necessarily feel the urge of idealism.
                </li>
                <li>The attitude of the government of India is another big challenge. Some of its agencies refuse to
                    disclose the required information.
                </li>
                <li>In PMO, the rejection rate is very high. The Commission does not have enough power for getting
                    responses to its questions
                </li>
                <li>It does not have the mechanisms for following up on whether its orders have been complied with.</li>
                <li>The Information Officers do not necessarily get the right training</li>
                <li>Universities could include the RTI Act in their curriculum and offer not only degrees, but also
                    continuing training for helping this major achievement to remain relevant.

            <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>National Green Tribunal called for a <strong>complete ban on “plastic carry bags</strong>” smaller
                    than 50 microns in Delhi’s markets.
                </li>
                <li>Maximum usage of plastic bags was to carry vegetables, fruit, meat and fish because they were
                    convenient, easily available and cost-effective.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Problems associated with plastic bags:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Serious environmental degradation</li>
                <li>Harm to public health, animals in the city</li>
                <li>Ability to choke up drains and sewer lines, causing floods during the rainy season.</li>
                <li>Plastic was inherently not a public health hazard, but the inability to collect plastic waste leads
                    to health hazards
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Government Initiative to clean up the menace:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>In 2016, the government notified <strong>Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016</strong>, which
                    regulate manufacture, sale, distribution and use of plastic carry bags
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Disposal problem</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Within a fortnight after the NGT ban, authorities in Delhi had seized 9,000 kg of plastic carry bags
                    but have since struggled to find effective ways to dispose of it.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Effective disposal:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Himachal Pradesh</strong>, the first state in the country to impose a ban on the use of
                    plastic bags in 2003, effectively managed the seized plastic bags.
                </li>
                <li>The state sought the help of rag pickers to collect the plastic bags and mixed it with other
                    materials and then used it for road construction.
                </li>
                <li>The plastic waste of Shimla and Chandigarh were reportedly processed together and the refuse drive
                    fuel (RDF) is sent to power plants in Patiala and Nakodar in Punjab.
                </li>
                <li>The confiscated bags should be returned to the manufacturers or mixed with other materials and
                    recycled.
                </li>
                <li>Delhi has waste-to-energy plants, it could also be sent there</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Way forwards:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>With last month’s order, the NGT was reiterating an earlier ban on use of disposable plastic in
                    Delhi from January 1, 2017.
                </li>
                <li>Ban driven as a government programme will head nowhere. It must be made as a <strong>‘people’s
                    movement’.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Best example:</strong> In 2016, Kannur district in Kerala launched a campaign with the
                    slogan ‘Nalla Nadu, Nalla Mannu’ — good village, good soil — which culminated in a complete ban on
                    plastic carry bags five months later
                </li>
                <li>Just imposing a ban is not enough. We have to first give users alternatives to plastic bags, then
                    impose the ban and only after that penalise violators with fines.
                </li>
                <li>There has to be at least six months of aggressive campaigning before such a ban is imposed.</li>
                <li>This has also been the strategy in countries like Kenya and Rwanda.</li>
                <li>Banning plastic should be targeted towards behaviour change</li>
            </ul>

                <p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>The World Trade Organization (WTO) is an intergovernmental organization which regulates international
                    trade.</p>
                <p><span>The WTO is attempting to complete negotiations on the Doha Development Round, which was launched in 2001 with an explicit focus on developing countries. As of June 2012, the future of the Doha Round remained uncertain: the work programme lists 21 subjects in which the original deadline of 1 January 2005 was missed, and the round is still incomplete. The conflict between free trade on industrial goods and services but retention of protectionism on farm subsidies to domestic agricultural sector (requested by developed countries) and the substantiation of fair trade on agricultural products (requested by developing countries) remain the major obstacles. This impasse has made it impossible to launch new WTO negotiations beyond the Doha Development Round. As a result, there have been an increasing number of bilateral free trade agreements between governments. As of July 2012, there were various negotiation groups in the WTO system for the current agricultural trade negotiation which is in the condition of stalemate.</span>

            <p><strong>In news:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The accomplishments of modern India are recognized around the world</li>
                <li>A country that was a symbol of hunger and poverty at the time of Independence and admonished for its
                    Hindu rate of growth during the initial decades has now transformed itself into one of the fastest
                    growing major economies
                </li>
                <li>These economic achievements are extensive, especially when considering the challenges that arose
                    from following democratic governance after decades of oppressive colonial rule and being a
                    multi-religious secular entity
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Economic Growth perspective:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>There have been efforts to track individual social outcomes such as health, education and safety
                </li>
                <li>The National University of Educational Planning and Administration and the Government of India
                    (Ministry of Human Resource Development, Department of School Education and Literacy) compute an
                    Educational Development Index for primary and upper primary levels of education that compare States
                    on different aspects on education universalization
                </li>
                <li>NITI Aayog has rolled out the health, education and water index</li>
                <li>A common measure to quantify the social progress of Indian States that can pinpoint the achievements
                    and the challenges is still missing
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Social Progress Index</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A Social Progress Index could bridge this gap</li>
                <li>It would rank States using social and environmental indicators on the basis of their capability to
                    provide for basic needs such as shelter, water, and sanitation, a foundation for well-being
                </li>
                <li>Along with education, health, and communication facilities</li>
                <li>It would analyze the prejudices that prevail in a region prohibiting people from making their
                    personal decisions
                </li>
                <li>Also evaluate whether citizens have personal rights and freedom or whether they are susceptible to
                    child labour, human trafficking, corruption, etc
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Highlights of a key study results:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A study was conducted during 2005-2016 to help analyze whether States, especially using social and
                    environmental indicators, are heading in the right direction
                </li>
                <li>The overall social progress score for the country now stands at 57.03 (on a 0-100 scale),
                    approximately eight points higher than in 2005
                </li>
                <li>The country performs better in the provision of basic human needs rather than opportunities for its
                    citizens
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong> Inference:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>All the States have climbed the social progress ladder, with the group of States that had the worst
                    performance in 2005
                </li>
                <li>Tripura, Meghalaya, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, and Bihar are now showing
                    improvement
                </li>
                <li>This suggests that States with a relatively low level of social progress can improve rapidly</li>
                <li>Also the fact that the States that have achieved a threshold level of social progress, driving
                    improvements becomes more difficult
                </li>
                <li>Average improvement was the lowest among the group of States that were categorized as “Very High
                    Social Progress” in 2005
                </li>
                <li>The greatest improvements have been in areas where social progress most often accompanies economic
                    prosperity
                </li>
                <li>Areas, where performance has declined or stagnated, is where the correlation with economic
                    development is weak
                </li>
                <li>“Access to Information &amp; Communication and Inclusion” depicts a strong relationship with per
                    capita GDP and are the ones that have improved the most over the years
                </li>
                <li>“Health and Wellness &amp; Environmental Quality”, that are least correlated with economic
                    development, have eroded
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Way Forward</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The overall findings show that while the economy is on the right track, there is an urgent need to
                    identify and focus on social parametersThe reliance on the idea that economic development will
                    automatically transform social conditions will hamper further improvements in social progress.
                    Social progress needs to be stimulated by focussing on policies directly targeting social issues
                </li>

            <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
            <p>Importance of commonwealth for India</p>
            <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>With the upcoming visit of Prince of Wales to India, India and the UK have an opportunity to think
                    afresh about the future of the Commonwealth
                </li>
                <li>In the past an archaic anti-colonial view has distorted India’s view of the commonwealth</li>
                <li>And it was no surprise then that the Indian leadership stayed away from the last three Commonwealth
                    summits in Malta, Colombo and Perth for one reason or another.
                </li>
                <li>He is coming to India to invite PM Narendra Modi to attend the Commonwealth Summit in London in
                    April 2018
                </li>
                <li>The London Summit of the 52-nation forum, formally called the “Commonwealth Heads of Government
                    Meeting” is significant for many reasons
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Significance of the summit</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Charles is likely to take over from Queen Elizabeth as the head of the organisation</li>
                <li>As the largest country in the Commonwealth, India will have a key role in formalising this
                    transition
                </li>
                <li>An even more important change is Britain’s r impending separation from the European Union</li>
                <li>After the separation, the UK is making a big push to reconnect with its historic partners in the
                    Commonwealth and the Anglosphere
                </li>
                <li>The UK wants commonwealth should have greater role in resolving contemporary global problems like
                    climate change, urbanisation and sustainable development
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>India’s Concern:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The political conservatives in India, who dismiss the Commonwealth as a relic from the past, may not
                    find Charles too persuasive
                </li>
                <li>Delhi’s lack of interest in the Commonwealth in recent decades was reinforced by the preoccupation
                    with<br/>(1) Managing the complex relationships with its immediate neighbours                  (2)
                    Reordering its ties with the major powers<br/>(3) And becoming part of regional institutions like
                    the Association of the South            East
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Nehru and Common wealth:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Despite considerable opposition from the Indian National Congress and many others, Nehru decided to
                    join the Commonwealth.
                </li>
                <li>Nehru understood that the Commonwealth and British connection gave India a measure of flexibility in
                    a world engulfed by the Cold War
                </li>
                <li>It allowed him to maintain a substantive political and economic link to the West even as he refused
                    to become part of its alliance system
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Importance of Commonwealth for both India and the UK</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>For a Britain that is reinventing itself politically after Brexit, the Commonwealth has become an
                    important forum to recalibrate London’s international relations
                </li>
                <li>For a rising India, the Commonwealth is the most natural theatre to demonstrate its credibility as a
                    “leading power”
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The way forward</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The question today, then, is no longer about whether India and Britain should resurrect the
                    Commonwealth, but how
                </li>
                <li>Modi’s consultations with Charles this week should be the first step towards a revival of the
                    Commonwealth at the London summit next April
                </li>

            <p><strong>Directions given by the Union health minister:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The union health ministry has asked private hospitals to notify it all cases of the disease reported
                    in their facilities
                </li>
                <li>The government is aiming to eliminate tuberculosis (TB) by 2025</li>
                <li>The aim is to check under-reporting of tuberculosis, which has been flagged as a major area of
                    concern by UN health agency World Health Organisation (WHO)
                </li>

            <p><strong>Other steps by the government</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The ministry will also set up two 24X7 call centres — in Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh — so that
                    patients can avail all information related to the disease by calling up these toll free numbers
                </li>
                <li>The ministry has also roped in the Indian Medical Association for further sensitisation of the
                    health institutions
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key Facts:</strong></p>
            <ul>

                    accounting for 64% of the 10.4 million new tuberculosis cases worldwide in 2016
                </li>
                <li>India along with China and Russia accounted for almost of half of the 490,000, multi drug-resistant
                    TB (MDR- TB) cases registered in 2016

            <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Crude oil futures rose 83 per cent to Rs 3,630 per barrel as speculators widened their positions
                    amid a firm trend overseas.
                </li>
                <li>At the Multi Commodity Exchange, crude oil for December delivery was trading higher by Rs 30 or 0.83
                    per cent at Rs 3,630 per barrel in 62 lots.
                </li>
                <li>On similar lines, crude for delivery in current month was trading higher by Rs 29 or 0.81 per cent
                    at Rs 3,608 per barrel in a business turnover of 1,416 lots.
                </li>
                <li>Analysts said rise in crude oil futures was largely in tandem with a firm trend in global market
                    where prices hit their highest levels since July 2015 as markets tightened, while Saudi Arabia’s
                    crown prince cemented his power over the weekend through an anti-corruption crackdown that included
                    high profile arrests.
                </li>
                <li>Meanwhile, the US benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude prices surged 12 cents or 0.22 per cent to

            <ul>
                <li>After an initial surge in digital payments, largely attributed to a shortage of cash in the banking
                    system, digital transactions have seen a dip.This indicates a slow reversal in the usage of digital
                    platforms
                </li>
                <li>This is despite doubling of point of sale (PoS) machines in merchant establishments across the

                <li>Mobile wallets have also seen a dip in volumes and value of transactions after the initial surge
                </li>
                <li>Unified Payment Interface (UPI), the payment platform of NPCI — promoted by RBI — had a slow takeoff
                    even after the launch of BHIM (Bharat Interface for Money), which uses the UPI platform. The value
                    of transactions through UPI are much below one percent of the total electronic payments in the
                    country
                </li>
                <li>Bankers and analysts said a complete switch back to pre-November 8 trends has not happened. It shows
                    the possibility that there has been some behavioral change in transactions patterns
                </li>
                <li>At a modest 11 percent, the country’s electronic personal consumption expenditure (ePCE) rate is a
                    far cry from some leading economies with ePCE rates upwards of 60 percent
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>True reality:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>With over 800 million debit cards and over 30 million credit cards in the market, almost every
                    household in India now has access to a digital payment
                </li>
                <li>This has not yet translated into digital transactions</li>
                <li>At 3 times growth in payment volumes and over 3.5 times growth in transactions, consumers are
                    beginning to enjoy the benefits of the debit card beyond its use as an ATM withdrawal instrument
                </li>
                <li>The year after demonetisation was driven by innovation, mainly new mobile applications allowing
                    merchants to receive digital payments via UPI, Link Based, Bharat QR Scan &amp; Pay to mPOS
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>GST &amp; digitization</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>GST has given the much-needed boost to the digitization initiative</li>
                <li>It will now be difficult to make cash deals anymore with digital trails of every transaction</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Way forward</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Both the government and the regulators need to continue the initiatives taken by them</li>
                <li>Principle-based policies, regulation versus current approach of product or entity based regulations,
                    seamless access to payments network and other critical payments infrastructures like UPI and RTGS
                    will make sure that incentives continue to grow for digital transactions

            <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
            <p> </p>
            <ul>
                <li>FIJI set the stage for the fresh edition of the climate change conference, urging the world to
                    commit itself to a 1.5 degree celsius limit on global warming, rather than a two-degree target, as
                    it moves towards finalising the rule-book for the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement.
                </li>
                <li>The two-week conference, an annual year-end affair, is being held under the shadow of the decision
                    of the USA administration to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement, a move that severely
                    undermines the goals and objectives of that agreement.
                </li>
                <li>On the opening day of the conference, however, there were no overt references to the US decision,
                    even though that was the big subject of discussion in informal conversations.
                </li>
                <li>The US is participating in the conference, since its withdrawal cannot become effective until 2020,
                    but its delegation remained silent on the opening day.
                </li>
                <li>India and other “like-minded developing countries” are a group of about 25 nations made an early
                    intervention on Monday in a fresh bid to force the developed countries to deliver on their
                    commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, the precursor to the Paris Agreement, which still has three
                    years to go before expiring in 2020.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Doha developments:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Amendments made to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol in Doha in 2013 extended the mandate of developed
                    countries to take targeted cuts to their greenhouse gas emissions till 2020.
                </li>
                <li>The earlier mandate was to make emission cuts between 2005 and 2012.</li>
                <li>The Doha amendments are yet to become operational because they haven’t been ratified by enough
                    countries.
                </li>
                <li>Ratification of the Doha amendments was not included in the agenda of the current conference, which
                    India and some other countries objected.
                </li>
                <li>They argued that the conference must decide on a deadline, possibly sometime next year, for every
                    country to ratify the Doha amendments.
                </li>
                <li>The developed countries are trying to avoid their responsibilities under the Kyoto Protocol.The
                    Kyoto Protocol is not yet dead.There is still plenty that can be done within Kyoto Protocol provided
                    there is intention to do so.
                </li>
                <li>Developing countries will continue to press for early operationalisation of the Doha amendments so
                    that we can see some action being taken in the pre-2020 period as well.
                </li>
                <li>Fiji, the host and president of the conference, agreed to consider the suggestion by India and other
                    countries, and appointed a facilitator to hold consultations .
                </li>
                <li>Fiji, which, like many other small island nations, is facing the worst impact of rising sea levels
                    as a result of climate change, insisted that countries should adopt a 1.5 degree target.
                </li>
                <li>Small island countries are the most vocal in supporting the 1.5 degree target, threatened as their
                    existence is by the rising seas.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The Paris Agreement</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Paris Agreement wants the world to prevent the rise in global temperature beyond 2 degree
                    celsius from pre-industrial levels, though it acknowledges that the effort to contain the
                    temperature rise to within 1.5 degree celsius must not be abandoned.
                </li>
                <li>In the next two weeks and the year ahead to do everything we can to make the Paris Agreement work
                    and to advance ambition and support for climate action before 2020.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Way Forward</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A greater effort is needed from the developed countries and big emitters in reducing their
                    emissions.
                </li>
                <li>Aiming for 1.5 degrees is a serious challenge. But it provides a mission to the countries and
                    engages their capacity for ingenuity, for organisation and sheer hard work.
                </li>
                <li>And may be the target will be achieved when humanity’s capacity to innovate is unleashed.</li>
                <li>The latest scientific assessments indicated that the world was actually moving towards a 3 to 5
                    degree celsius temperature rise.
                </li>
                <li>A new report by WMO also showed that the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere had crossed
                    403 parts per million, the highest ever.
                </li>
                <li>Scientists believe that concentrations of 450 ppm would lead to catastrophic and irreversible damage
                    to the earth.

                <p>Topic: Economy <br/> Level: Moderate</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>The World Trade Organization (WTO) is an intergovernmental organization which regulates international
                    trade.</p>
                <p>The WTO is attempting to complete negotiations on the Doha Development Round, which was launched in
                    2001 with an explicit focus on developing countries. As of June 2012, the future of the Doha Round
                    remained uncertain: the work programme lists 21 subjects in which the original deadline of 1 January
                    2005 was missed, and the round is still incomplete. The conflict between free trade on industrial
                    goods and services but retention of protectionism on farm subsidies to domestic agricultural sector
                    (requested by developed countries) and the substantiation of fair trade on agricultural products
                    (requested by developing countries) remain the major obstacles. This impasse has made it impossible
                    to launch new WTO negotiations beyond the Doha Development Round. As a result, there have been an
                    increasing number of bilateral free trade agreements between governments. As of July 2012, there
                    were various negotiation groups in the WTO system for the current agricultural trade negotiation
                    which is in the condition of stalemate.</p></div>

                <p>Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) is a <strong>nonprofit</strong> organisation formed to create a
                    platform for all the concerned parties i.e. stakeholders, government, taxpayers to collaborate on a
                    single portal. The portal will be accessible to the central government which will track down every
                    transaction on its end while the taxpayers will be having a vast service to return file their taxes
                    and maintain the details.</p></div>

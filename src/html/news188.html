        <div id="National Mineral">
            <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Union environment ministry has suggested to the Union mines ministry that the ‘polluter pays’
                    principle which states that those who produce pollution should pay for the damage done to human
                    health and the environment should be included in the national mineral policy (NMP) so that the
                    miners become “cautious” and “responsible”.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Reasons for such a move:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Earlier in August, the Supreme Court had passed a judgment, wherein it directed the Central
                    government to revisit the NMP, 2008, and announce a “fresh and more effective, meaningful and
                    implementable policy” before the end of this year.
                </li>
                <li>The mines ministry formed a committee which included officials from various ministries including
                    Union environment ministry after this judgment and its first meeting took place in August.
                </li>
                <li>The committee in its recent meeting suggested that ‘polluter pays’ principle may be incorporated in
                    the policy so that the miners become cautious and undertake mining in a responsible manner.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>SC judgment regarding Polluter Pays principle</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>In 1996, the Supreme Court held the ‘polluter pays’ principle to be part of the environmental law of
                    the country in the case of Vellore Citizens’ Welfare Forum vs. Union of India and Others.
                </li>
                <li>The Supreme Court stated that the ‘polluter pays’ principle means that the absolute liability for
                    harm to the environment extends not only to compensate the victims of pollution but also the cost of
                    restoring the environmental degradation.
                </li>
                <li>Remediation of the damaged environment is part of the process of ‘Sustainable Development’ and as
                    such polluter is liable to pay the cost to the individual sufferers as well as the cost of reversing
                    the damaged ecology.
                </li>
                <li>Currently, National Green Tribunals across the country work on the ‘polluter pays’ principle as it
                    is mentioned in its governing law: National Green Tribunal Act, 2010.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Committee suggestions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The committee added that prospecting license (PL) should not be allowed in very dense and thick
                    forests as it is very difficult to give clearance in those cases.
                </li>
                <li>A reconnaissance permit (RP) is granted for preliminary prospecting through regional, aerial,
                    geophysical or geochemical surveys and geological mapping.
                </li>
                <li>A PL is required for exploring, locating and proving mineral deposits.</li>
                <li>A mining lease (ML) is required to finally extract minerals.</li>
                <li>Also, while developing mining infrastructure in the area, it should be ensured that the process
                    should cause only minimum damage to flora and fauna of that area by using state-of-the-art
                    techniques.
                </li>
                <li>Conservation of biodiversity, forest wildlife should be an integral part of NMP.</li>
                <li>In order to ensure rehabilitation and reclamation of mined areas, specific timelines or clear
                    guidelines should be formulated.
                </li>
                <li>According to the Ministry of Mines, reclamation has to be taken up by the forest department of
                    MOEFCC as they have collected NPV (Net Present Value) / CAMPA (Compensatory Afforestation Management
                    and Planning Authority) funds.
                </li>
                <li>But, CAMPA funds are for compensation for the trees felled on account of mining and NPV is for the
                    damage caused to the eco-system and emphasized that it is the responsibility of miners to undertake
                    reclamation work.
                </li>

                    map air pollution use accurate instruments.
                </li>
                <li>The <strong>Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)-National Physical Laboratory
                    (NPL)</strong> is in the process of setting up ‘<strong>gas standards’</strong>, or reference
                    samples of <strong>Carbon Monoxide (CO), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Nitrous Oxide (NO2) and Particulate
                        –Pb (lead), –As (Arsenic) and –Ni (Nickel).</strong></li>
                <li>Currently, the <strong>National Ambient Air Quality standards</strong> specify the upper limits for
                    pollutants and, based on this, the <strong>Air Quality Index</strong> — that grades air quality in
                    cities from ‘<strong>Good’ to ‘Severe’</strong> — is prepared for several Indian cities.
                </li>
                <li>CPCB has prescribed guidelines for the maximum permissible levels of 12 gases and pollutants,

                    would not compel it to ratify the <strong>UN Convention against Torture</strong>, or command it to

                <li>The National Human Rights Commission has been urging the government to recognise torture as a

                <li>The government released a white paper looking into the scope of a data protection law, and opened up
                    for public discussion till December 31, issues pertaining to its ambit, what constitutes personal
                    data, what is sensitive data, and the international applicability of such a law.
                </li>
                <li>The <strong>N. Srikrishna committee</strong>, set up under the <strong>Ministry of Electronics and
                    Information Technology</strong>, in the white paper recommended that the law be applicable to all
                    processing of personal data that takes place within India or by an entity that has a presence in
                    India.
                </li>
                <li>The paper noted that it may be necessary to make the law applicable to all kinds of processing that
                    the government may have a “legitimate interest in regulating” even though it may not be entirely
                    based in India or may be carried out by non-Indian entities that do not have a presence in India.
                </li>
                <li>The committee set limits on this extended jurisdiction, though, saying that the law should not be so
                    wide as to constitute an unnecessary interference with the jurisdiction of other countries or have
                    the effect of making it a general law of the Internet.
                </li>
                <li>For instance, the mere fact that a website (operated from abroad) is accessible from India should
                    not be a reason for subjecting the website to Indian law
                </li>
                <li>According to the paper the personal data “ought to include any kind of information including

            <ul>
                <li>The Centre’s decision to assign infrastructure status to the logistics industry is a good first
                    move, but there are several other problems that need to be addressed such as the lack of proper
                    regulatory oversight and the lack of skilling in the sector.
                </li>
                <li>The e-waybill system also needs several improvements before it can viably be rolled out across the
                    country, such as the removal of the need for e-waybills for intra-city or intra-State transport and
                    the modification of the validity of the e-waybills.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Main Problems:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The first obvious problem is that generally this is an industry that is not very regulated, which
                    means that it has become a highly fragmented industry.
                </li>
                <li>The second problem is that it employs a large number of blue collar workers but there isn’t enough
                    infrastructure to train them.
                </li>
                <li>The e-waybill system — timed at tracking the transport of goods worth ₹50,000 or more across the
                    country — is probably one of the most critical and contentious points as far as the GST system is
                    concerned.

            <p><strong>Impact:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>If approved, energy prices across sectors would become market-driven and subsides would be limited

            <ul>
                <li>The government think tank Niti Aayog in June released a draft National Energy Policy (NEP), on which
                    it had been working since 2015.

                <li>Prime Minister had chaired interministerial consultations on the policy after the coal ministry
                    expressed reservations over market-driven prices that would pose a threat to the monopoly and

            <p><strong>Highlights of draft NEP:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The policy will help India integrate with the global energy world without compromising on the energy
                    needs of the poorest of the poor, who will continue to get subsidy on all forms of energy directly
                    into their bank accounts through direct benefit transfer.
                </li>
                <li>The outward-looking policy is against any kind of subsidies at the production and distribution
                    levels as it distorts the system.
                </li>
                <li>Instead, it has strongly vouched for DBT as the technological platform to transfer subsidies to the
                    poor after the success of LPG.
                </li>
                <li>In its draft policy, Niti Aayog said India’s energy demand was likely to soar around three times by
                    2040, leading to increase in overall primary energy imports.
                </li>
                <li>It had also made a case for a single regulator to govern India’s energy market to make ‘India’s
                    economy energy-ready’ by 2040.
                </li>
                <li>The NEP will replace the Integrated Energy Policy of the UPA regime and lay the road map for
                    government push towards clean energy and reducing fuel import.
                </li>
                <li>According to the draft NEP, the period 2017-2040 is expected to witness a quantum leap in the uptake
                    of renewable energy, drastic reduction in energy intensity, doubling of per-capita energy
                    consumption and tripling of per-capita electricity consumption.

            <p><strong>In news:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>As per the data reported by the six divisional commissionerates across the state, 2,414 farmer
                    suicides were reported in the state between 1 January and 31 October. This is happening five months
                    after a Rs34,022-crore farm loan waiver
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Farm loan waiver scheme:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ministers, farm sector experts, and activists say bureaucratic bottlenecks and technical snags have
                    hampered the implementation of the scheme, aggravating the crisis
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Corruption the main culprit:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The online system has bared several problems and bogus accounts, it has also caused delays</li>
                <li>Since there is no money to be made, there is no incentive for government staff and bank
                    officials(especially the cooperative banks) to speed up the implementation
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Fake accounts:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Government had announced the farm loan waiver on 24 June, which it claimed would benefit 8.9 million
                    farmers
                </li>
                <li>But the online application system coupled with Aadhaar identification helped banks and the
                    government weed out nearly 2 million names
                </li>
                <li>The final list of eligible beneficiaries the government drew up has 5.6 million farmers</li>
                <li>But due to administrative reasons, the government could transfer benefits to only 2.5 lakh farmers
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Financial assistance to the families of deceased farmers</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Of the 2,414 farm suicides reported till October end, the government has identified 1,277 cases as
                    “eligible” for ex-gratia financial assistance
                </li>
                <li>Of these, relatives of 1,246 farmers have already been given the assistance of Rs1 lakh each</li>
                <li>The government has rejected financial assistance in 728 cases terming them “ineligible” and another
                    409 cases are being probed further

                <li><strong>Earlier belief:</strong> pre-monsoon aerosol loading results in decrease in seasonal
                    rainfall due to aerosol-solar radiation interactions.

                        <li>Long-term (2002-2013) satellite observational study and model-based analysis by researchers
                            from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur has found that higher aerosol loading
                            results in delayed but more rainfall over Central and Northern India.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Higher aerosol loading changes cloud properties in terms of size (both height and
                            width) and microphysics, which results in more rainfall.</strong></li>
                        <li>When aerosol particles are higher, the number of nucleation sites increases resulting in far
                            too many number of droplets. Under such circumstances, it takes time for the droplets to
                            grow in size through condensation.

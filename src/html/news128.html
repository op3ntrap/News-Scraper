                    <li>The Home Ministry has asked all banks, private and public sector, to enable their core banking
                        facility in Hindi.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Directives given:</strong> banks have been asked to update databases in Hindi and
                        customers should not be compelled to fill forms only in English.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Key fact:</strong> As per <strong>Official Languages Act,</strong> 1963 there was no
                        provision of punitive action for not using Hindi in official communication but the language
                        could only be promoted through <strong>“persuasion and encouragement.”</strong></li>
                    <li>States are free to choose their language; Hindi-speaking States should also learn other regional

                <ul>
                    <li>Global weather disasters and the pollution levels of major Indian cities are clear indications
                        that the costs of pollution are beginning to spiral out of control for citizens and economies
                        alike.

                    <li>The climate change disruption holds both-</li>
                    <li>Positive-There is a need to drastically reduce CO2 footprint per capita and this calls for
                        forward-thinking nations to develop new technologies in energy-efficient products and services.
                    </li>
                    <li>Negative– Those nations not able to develop new technologies will not only harm us all but be
                        ultimately left behind from a technology and business perspective.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Indian Scenario</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>India’s announcement to move from fossil fuel-driven vehicles to electric vehicles is
                        positive.
                    </li>
                    <li>Over the last 30-40 years, India has developed the capability to engineer and build globally
                        competitive vehicles based on internal combustion engines (ICEs). Via joint ventures, technology
                        licences and technology transfer, Indian manufacturers and suppliers have built full-fledged
                        capabilities in ICEs.
                    </li>
                    <li>This ensured personal mobility for the Indian middle class at price points that are unmatched
                        globally.
                    </li>
                    <li>Investment in ICEs has helped to increase exports, create highly skilled and well paid jobs.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Risks involved:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Technology transfer and joint ventures have to be encouraged to ensure indigenization of
                        technology. Industry must play as much a leading role in electric vehicles as it does today in
                        ICEs to ensure employment, capability building and tax revenue.
                    </li>
                    <li>Localization is crucial to avoid replacement of an oil import bill with a battery import bill or
                        rather dependency on Gulf states to China.
                    </li>
                    <li>The government needs to support relevant volumes in chosen segments, e.g., via public tenders,
                        incentives or access restrictions. Without a reasonable visibility of volumes, businesses will
                        not invest.
                    </li>
                    <li>Policy clarity -While a number of green technologies can be pursued, the practical reality of
                        the Indian automotive industry is that resources for investment are limited
                    </li>
                    <li>Policy consistency– Long-term investments are required; sudden policy changes that alter
                        business case assumptions can drive companies into ruin.
                    </li>
                    <li>Technology risks such as liability issues around battery swapping, unstable battery technology,
                        recycling of batteries and infrastructure requirements need to be assessed in detail.
                    </li>
                    <li>Life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have to be considered when comparing battery electric
                        vehicles with fossil fuel vehicles.
                    </li>
                    <li>GHG emissions during battery production and recycling must be</li>
                    <li>The cases such as rural vs metro needs, 2-/3-wheeler vs 4-wheeler applications—will have to be
                        studied in detail.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Way Forward</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The case studies of the US, Germany, France, Japan, Korea and China show, a strong automotive
                        industry creates disproportionate benefits in technology, capability, taxes and employment for
                        the country of origin of manufacturers and suppliers.
                    </li>
                    <li>In an environment, where job creation is falling far short of population growth, active
                        development of a high-paying sector is paramount.
                    </li>
                    <li>The need for a transition to electric vehicles in India is undeniable but it has to gradual
                        rather than binary.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Indian industry need to rework their strategies and re-allocate investments.</li>
                    <li>The full force of India’s engineering and entrepreneurial talent will only be brought to bear
                        with consistent cooperation between industry and government.

                        the Indian economy has also made the need for corrective measures more urgent

                <ul>
                    <li>The RBI’s asset quality review has revealed that the gross NPA ratio of both public and private
                        sector banks is higher than was earlier thought
                    </li>
                    <li>But in the PSU banks, it is alarming at about 12%</li>
                    <li>And this is an underestimate, because it does not include assets that are “stressed” but not yet
                        NPAs

                    <li>The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) is a major reform</li>

                    </li>
                    <li>And is admitted, the powers of the management and the board are transferred to an independent
                        insolvency professional (IP)
                    </li>
                    <li>The IP then looks for someone willing to take over the project on suitable terms</li>
                    <li>If no one is willing to take over, or the banks don’t accept the debt reduction implied by the
                        package, the company is simply liquidated
                    </li>
                    <li>The process changes the incentive structure facing bank managements by giving them a legally
                        sanctified method of determining what is a reasonable haircut(haircut means cut in actual price
                        of the project)
                    </li>
                    <li>Since the alternative is liquidation, they(bank) should be willing to accept any haircut that
                        gives them more than they would get from liquidation
                    </li>
                    <li>The process will certainly clean up the books of the banks over the next 12 months or so</li>
                    <li>But it will also mean acceptance of large losses and a corresponding depletion of capital</li>

                    <li>In 2015, the finance ministry had estimated that the PSU banks needed Rs2.4 trillion of
                        capital
                    </li>
                    <li>Of this capital Rs1.1 trillion was to come from the market, Rs60,000 crore from retained
                        profits, and the remaining Rs 70,000 crore from the budget
                    </li>
                    <li>But this is clearly insufficient because the NPA situation has turned out to be much worse than
                        expected
                    </li>
                    <li>Fitch Ratings has estimated that Indian PSU banks will need as much as Rs4 trillion of capital
                        by end of March 2019 to meet the capital requirements under Basel III
                    </li>
                    <li>The scope for using public funds to recapitalize the PSU banks can only be judged on the basis
                        of a holistic view of the many other demands for government expenditure
                    </li>

                    <li>The idea of merging PSBs, is not reform at all</li>
                    <li>Merging strong banks with other banks will do nothing to improve the average balance sheet</li>
                    <li>The most important reform will be to reduce the government’s equity to 33% in selected PSU
                        banks
                    </li>
                    <li>This would allow the stronger PSU banks to raise additional capital from the market, including

                    <li>An unexpectedly strong solar storm hit Mars this month, sparking a global aurora and doubling
                        radiation levels on the red planet.
                    </li>
                    <li>The solar event on September 11 sparked an aurora more than 25 times brighter than any
                        previously seen by the MAVEN orbiter, which has been studying the Martian atmosphere’s
                        interaction with the solar wind since 2014.
                    </li>
                    <li>It produced radiation levels on the surface more than double any previously measured by the
                        Curiosity rover’s Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) since that mission’s landing in 2012. The
                        high readings lasted more than two days.

                    <li>Death toll at Uttar Pradesh hospital counts to 104.</li>
                    <li>NHRC issued a notice to the Uttar Pradesh government seeking a detailed report within four weeks
                        over the deaths of dozens of children and others at the Baba Raghav Das Medical College hospital
                        in Gorakhpur.
                    </li>
                    <li>National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) termed the case as serious abuse of the right to life of
                        patients.
                    </li>
                    <li>About 60 patients hospitalized to the intensive care unit of the government-run unit expired
                        because of the oxygen supply being clogged due to pending payments to the supplier.
                    </li>
                    <li>The government had upheld that the children expired due to diverse illnesses, including Japanese
                        encephalitis (JE)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>What is encephalitis?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Encephalitis is a potentially life-threatening but rare disease causing “acute inflammation” of
                        the brain.
                    </li>
                    <li>Meaning of Acute: when a disease appears abruptly and grows at a fast pace.</li>
                    <li>A person afflicted with encephalitis requires serious medical attention.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>What are the causes of encephalitis?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The disease can occur in people of all ages, but children and the elderly are more at risk of
                        being afflicted with the disease.
                    </li>
                    <li>The usual cause of the rare disease is either a viral infection.</li>
                    <li>Sometimes it is caused when the brain’s own immune system mistakenly attacks brain tissue.</li>
                    <li>In rare cases, encephalitis is caused due to bacterial infection, parasites, or may be prompted
                        from other infectious diseases.
                    </li>
                    <li>It is a non-communicable disease.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>What is Japanese encephalitis?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>One of the most common form of viral encephalitis in Asia is the Japanese encephalitis virus
                        (JEV), caused by mosquito-borne flavivirus.
                    </li>
                    <li>The disease belongs to the same genus as dengue, yellow and West Nile viruses.</li>
                    <li>JEV primarily affects children as most adults tend to attain natural immunity from the disease,
                        according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>How can the disease be prevented?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are several vaccinations that are effective in preventing the disease, including vaccines
                        for measles, mumps, rubella.
                    </li>
                    <li>People should also use proper clothing to prevent being bitten by mosquitoes in
                        mosquito-infested areas.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Is the disease prevalent in India? How severe is it?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Japanese Encephalitis is recognised as the leading cause of the disease in India.</li>
                    <li>Region affected: West Bengal, Uttar Praesh, Assam, Bihar, Manipur, Andhra Pradesh,Goa,
                        Pondicherry and Karnataka.
                    </li>
                    <li>Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are two states, which have seen the most number of encephalitis cases in
                        recent years.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Uttar Pradesh government in May this year launched a vaccination campaign in 38 sensitive
                        districts of the state to combat the JE virus.

                    <li>The sequence of interruptions throughout the Second World War due to the scarcity of essential

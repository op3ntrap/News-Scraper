                    <li>India’s fiscal deficit touched <strong>1% of the Budget estimate </strong>for FY18 at the end of
                        August
                    </li>
                    <li>Possible reason : The fiscal deficit has been higher than in the previous years because of the
                        quick start to spending facilitated by the early presentation of Budget on February 1
                    </li>
                    <li>According the data released by the Controller General of Accounts (CGA) , April-August fiscal
                        deficit is substantially higher than 76.4% for the year-earlier period

                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>According to government, it will meet the fiscal deficit target for the year</li>
                    <li>The target is3.2% of GDP, or Rs 5.47 lakh crore</li>
                    <li>In absolute terms, the fiscal deficit for April-August was Rs 5.25 lakh crore</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Targets achievement: </strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The government is considering ways of reviving growth, which slumped to its lowest in three
                        years in the June quarter
                    </li>
                    <li>The government has already allocated large sums to a few of its key schemes to ensure there was
                        no delay due to funds
                    </li>
                    <li>The revenue deficit was 133.9% of budget estimate against 91.7% last fiscal</li>
                    <li>With this big spending(allocations) done, the fiscal situation should start to improve as
                        revenues pick up pace in the second half of the financial year

                    <p>Occurrences of Coral Reefs in India The major reef formations in India are restricted to the Gulf
                        of Mannar, Gulf of Kachchh, Andaman and Nicobar and Lakshadweep Islands. Scattered coral growth
                        has also been reported along certain inter-tidal belts and submerged banks both on the east and
                        west coasts of the country. The reefs at present are important to the local community only to
                        the extent of sustenance fishing. Tourism is being developed at some places though local
                        communities do not benefit much from the revenue generated. The health of corals, as deduced
                        from the literature records since 60s has been on steady decline mainly due to stress from
                        anthropogenic pressures and interference. </p></div>

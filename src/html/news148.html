                <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The government in Rajasthan has <strong>promulgated an ordinance</strong> providing for prior
                        sanction for investigation against public servants, judges and magistrates for acts done
                        <strong>“in discharge of official duties”.</strong></li>
                    <li>Though the ordinance was promulgated last month and published in the official gazette, it came
                        to light on Friday.
                    </li>
                    <li>The State government may initiate a move to convert it into an Act during the Assembly session
                        beginning on October 23.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The Ordinance:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The ordinance has virtually shielded public servants from police investigations</li>
                    <li>It gone a step ahead by restraining the public and the media from disclosing the identity of
                        government officials until the sanction to proceed with the probe is obtained.
                    </li>
                    <li>The sanctioning authority may take up to six months for taking a decision.</li>
                    <li>While amending <strong>Sections 156 and 190</strong> of the Criminal Procedure Code, the
                        ordinance lays down that if the sanctioning authority does not take a decision within six
                        months, the prosecution sanction would be deemed to have been issued.
                    </li>
                    <li>Anyone found violating the restriction on printing, publishing or publicising the names,
                        photographs and details of public servants, judges and magistrates for whom the sanction is yet
                        to be granted, will be punished with two years’ imprisonment and fine, according to Section 5 of
                        the ordinance.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The issues with the ordinance:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>According to the opposition this ordinance will protect criminal and corrupt officials.</li>
                    <li>It would create a cover for wrongdoing by government officials and encourage others to indulge
                        in corruption.
                    </li>
                    <li>But the government has reiterated that the new provisions had been made to protect honest public
                        servants acting in good faith.

                <ul>
                    <li>Rajasthan has <strong>promulgated an ordinance</strong> providing for prior sanction for
                        investigation against public servants, judges and magistrates for acts done <strong>“in
                            discharge of official duties</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>In news:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <strong>People’s Union for Civil Liberties </strong>demanded repeal of a controversial
                        ordinance which has made public servants immune against investigation and barred the media from
                        disclosing their names until prior sanction is granted for their prosecution.
                    </li>
                    <li>The PUCL has also decided to challenge the ordinance in the Rajasthan High Court.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>PUCL remarks on the ordinance passed:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The ordinance is an attempt to silence the media and prevent the judiciary from exercising its
                        function of setting the criminal law in motion.
                    </li>
                    <li>The amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code and Indian Penal Code brought through the
                        ordinance went against the <strong>Supreme Court’s ruling in Lalita Kumari’s case</strong>,
                        2014. The judgment had dealt with both cognisable and non-cognisable offences committed by
                        public servants. The apex court’s Constitution Bench had held that an FIR has to be lodged and
                        investigation initiated by the police officer on the complaint about a cognisable offence. In
                        the cases of non-cognisable offences, the investigating officer is empowered to initiate a
                        preliminary enquiry and seek the court’s direction to obtain sanction for prosecution.
                    </li>
                    <li>The amendments, were superfluous and unnecessary as Section 197 of Cr.P.C. already provides
                        protection to public servants by making it mandatory for a court to take cognisance against them
                        after getting the government’s sanction. Instead of cognisance, the amendment refers to the word
                        “investigate”.

                <ul>
                    <li>India ranks 100th out of 119 countries on the global hunger index – behind North Korea,
                        Bangladesh, and Iraq but ahead of Pakistan
                    </li>
                    <li>The report ranked 119 countries in the developing world, nearly half of which have ‘extremely
                        alarming’, ‘alarming’ or ‘serious’ hunger levels
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Key Stats:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Absolute poverty in India in 2011/12 came out to be around 12 percent, not 23 percent as
                        officially reported (Tendulkar poverty line)
                    </li>
                    <li>The difference between 23 and 12 percent is the difference in measurement of consumption
                        measured on a 30-day recall basis for food rather than the more accurate seven-day recall basis
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>IFPRI’s Hunger Index</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>IFPRI hunger index is not a hunger index at all</li>
                    <li>It is an index about child mortality, and stunting, and wasting, and undernourishment of
                        children
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Addressing hunger:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A definition of hunger is needed to evaluate policies to alleviate hunger</li>
                    <li>The conventional approach is to measure hunger via calorie consumption</li>
                    <li>However, the caloric equation (poverty means low consumption of calories) has long been given up
                        as an indicator of hunger, or much else
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Problem in India:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Malnutrition affects stunting and weight and despite having considerably higher per capita
                        income, India has the same IFPRI nutrition (reported as hunger) status as sub-Saharan Africa
                    </li>
                    <li>There is a genuine nutrition absorption problem in India</li>
                    <li>The most likely cause of this is bad sanitation, a large component of which is open-defecation
                    </li>
                    <li>In the Indian environment, access to water and toilets, breastfeeding (to impart immunity in an
                        unhealthy environment), access to sound health advice/treatment, the prevalence of vaccination
                        and availability of vitamin supplements” are indicators of bad health, malnutrition etc.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Strategy to address the issue:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi started the drive to stop open defecation and said that we
                        needed to do so from the ramparts of the Red Fort
                    </li>
                    <li>A few years from now, the large role played by toilet construction, and adoption, in increasing
                        nutrition efficacy in India to East Asian levels will be visible
                    </li>

                        <p><strong>Explanation</strong> </p>
                        <p>DRDA has traditionally been the principal organ at the district level to oversee the
                            implementation of anti-poverty programmes of the Ministry of Rural Development. This agency
                            was created originally to implement the Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP).
                            Subsequently the DRDAs were entrusted with number of programmes of both state and central
                            governments. From April 1999 , a separate DRDA Administration has been introduced to take
                            care of the administrative costs. This aims at strengthening the DRDAs and makes them more
                            professional in managing the anti-poverty programmes and be an effective link between the
                            ministry and the district level.</p></div>

                                    <strong>social reform</strong> that would nudge people on the path to honesty and

                                    can’t be totally passed on to customers such as domestic refineries or exports since
                                    the prices of these products are linked to international benchmarks
                                </li>
                                <li>Possible migration: Any increase in prices due to higher taxes locally will
                                    encourage buyers to scout for international contracts offering similar products at
                                    cheaper prices

                                </li>
                                <li>Currently, the refineries take input tax credit on almost 80 per cent of the taxes

                                <li>CGST and SGST/UTGST were decided keeping in mind the federal structure of the

                                <li>This will be unlike state VAT, which is levied on the value of the goods inclusive

                            <p>The GST Rate Schedule for goods has put ‘solar power generating systems’ and
                                ‘photovoltaic cells whether or not assembled into modules or made into panels’ into
                                different tax brackets</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>GST rate schedule suggested that all solar power generating systems will be taxed at
                                    5%
                                </li>
                                <li>This will be similar to the tax on wind systems</li>
                                <li>This would put solar and wind in the same tax bracket as coal</li>
                                <li>Coal was previously taxed at 11.69%</li>
                                <li>Nuclear fuel too will be taxed at 5%</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>The state of confusion</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Another chapter of the GST rate schedule noted that semi-conductor devices including
                                    PV cells, which may or may not be assembled into modules or panels, would be taxed
                                    at 18%
                                </li>
                                <li>The council has put solar panels in the 5% category</li>
                                <li>The issue of tax on the remanining components of solar systems remains unresolved
                                    even on the eve of the rollout of the new fiscal regime
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>What will be the impact?</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>In the first scenario, utility scale solar (panels and parts), along with other
                                    renewable energy sources of electricity as well as coal, is taxed at 5%
                                </li>
                                <li>Analysis suggests that GST would result in a minor rise of 1.6% in solar tariffs
                                </li>
                                <li>In a thriving solar market, this is unlikely to create any setback for the sector
                                </li>
                                <li>While 5% doesn’t seem a mammoth figure, the rise in price of solar power is not
                                    insignificant when seen in conjunction with the decline in taxes on coal
                                </li>
                                <li>60% decline in taxation on coal is likely to make thermal power cheaper by as much
                                    as Rs 0.15
                                </li>
                                <li>This would set back some of the rapid advances made in recent times to close the
                                    price gap between the prices of solar power and thermal power
                                </li>
                                <li>The cumulative result, with a lower tax bracket for coal and higher (effective) tax
                                    implication for solar, would do little to incentivise already apprehensive utilities
                                    to purchase more solar power
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>The change in the tax regime would be accompanied by a change in use for the coal
                                    cess
                                </li>

                                <li><strong>Ionosphere: </strong>The ionosphere is called so because it is ionised by
                                    solar radiation. It plays an important part in atmospheric electricity and forms the
                                    inner edge of the magnetosphere. Ionosphere stretches from 50 to 1,000 km and
                                    typically overlaps both the exosphere and the thermosphere. It has practical
                                    importance because it influences, for example, radio propagation on the Earth. It is
                                    also responsible for auroras.

                                    <p>Explanation: Sonar (originally an acronym for SOund Navigation And Ranging) is a
                                        technique that uses sound propagation (usually underwater, as in submarine
                                        navigation) to navigate, communicate with or detect objects on or under the
                                        surface of the water, such as other vessels.</p>

                                        <li>Patola is a double ikat woven sari, usually made from silk, made in Patan,
                                            Gujarat, India.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>The word patola is the plural form; the singular is patolu.They are very
                                            expensive, once worn only by those belonging to royal and aristocratic
                                            families.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>These saris are popular among those who can afford the high prices.</li>
                                        <li>Velvet patola styles are also made in Surat. Patola-weaving is a closely
                                            guarded family tradition.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>There are three families in Patan that weave these highly prized double ikat
                                            saris. It is said that this technique is taught to no one in the family, but
                                            only to the sons.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>It can take six months to one year to make one sari due to the long process
                                            of dying each strand separately before weaving them together.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Patola was woven in Surat, Ahmedabad and Patan.</li>
                                        <li>Highly valued in Indonesia, became part of the local weaving tradition
                                            there.

                                    <p>Explanation:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Warm clouds are ones whose mass lies above the freezing level while cold
                                            clouds primarily exist where the temperature is below freezing.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>The collision-coalescence model applies to warm clouds that form in the
                                            tropics. <strong>Warm clouds are those that form at altitudes where the air
                                                temperature is above freezing</strong>. For precipitation to form under
                                            this model, there needs to be a variety of different size condensation
                                            nuclei. Large condensation nuclei will create large water droplets while
                                            smaller condensation nuclei create small ones. In order for the droplets to
                                            make their way to the surface they have to be heavy enough to overcome the
                                            resistance imposed by upwardly rising air that is fueling the development of
                                            the cloud. The smaller, lighter droplets are easily suspended in the
                                            updrafts of air, while the larger heavy collector droplets fall and collide
                                            with the smaller ones. Upon collision, the droplets coalesce into a bigger
                                            droplet. As the droplet falls, resistance by the air flattens the droplet to
                                            the point where it becomes unstable and breaks apart. With enough
                                            collisions, the droplet achieves a size sufficient to fall all the way to
                                            the surface.

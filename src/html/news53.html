            <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>July 18, 2016 ruling by Supreme Court</strong>: ordered for full implementation of Lodha
                    panel’s recommendations.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>In news</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Supreme Court indicated that it was <strong>open to relaxing its order</strong> directing the
                    Indian cricket board (BCCI) to accept the <strong>Justice Lodha panel’s</strong> <strong>recommendations</strong>
                    in full.
                </li>
                <li>Areas to be rethought:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reduction in the number of national selectors to three from five.</li>
                        <li>Restricting the appointment of selectors to players who have played Tests.</li>
                        <li>The one-state one-vote norm</li>
                        <li>The associate membership criteria.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>BCCI stance: </strong>BCCI had opposed the panel’s recommendations, including sweeping changes in
                administration, virtually marginalising the board.</p>
            <div class="well"><strong><strong>BASIC INFORMATION</strong></strong>
                <p><strong>Lodha Committee: </strong></p>
                <p><strong>The Lodha committee was formed in January, 2015 by the Supreme Court after the Mudgal
                    committee report on IPL.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Structural Reforms:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The committee recommended that a 9-member apex council replace the 14-member BCCI working
                        committee.
                    </li>
                    <li>Each of these office-bearers has a three-year term and can contest for a maximum three terms.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Lodha Committee also calls for dividing the governance into two parts: cricketing and
                        non-cricketing.
                    </li>
                    <li>The non-cricketing management will be handled by 6 professional managers headed by a CEO, and
                        the cricket matters like selection, coaching and performance evaluation should be left to the
                        players
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Organisation &amp; Office-bearers: Restrictions imposed</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each of these office-bearers has a 3-year term and can contest for a maximum three terms.</li>
                    <li>There will be a mandatory cooling off period after each term. Therefore, no office-bearer can
                        hold office consecutively in a row.
                    </li>
                    <li>No BCCI office-bearer can be Minister or government servant.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>State Cricket Associations: One Vote/State</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Committee recommended that one association should represent an entire state and only one
                        vote per state
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Indian Premier League: Maintain distance</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It recommends separate governing bodies for the IPL and BCCI.</li>
                    <li>There should be a 15-day gap between IPL season and national calender.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Betting: Legalize it</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It made a strong recommendation to lawmakers to legalise betting in cricket for all except
                        cricket players, officials and administrators.
                    </li>
                    <li>The players and others banned officials should disclose their assets to BCCI in a measure to
                        ensure that they do not bet.
                    </li>
                    <li>Betting is a $ 400 billion phenomenon practised across the globe and lawmakers in India should
                        enact laws to legalise it.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Fixing: Criminalize it</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The committee said that match-and spot-fixing should be made a criminal offence.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Conflict of Interest &amp; Corruption</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>One individual hold only one post in cricket administration. The office-bearers would have to
                        choose between positions in respective state associations and the parent body.
                    </li>
                    <li>A former High Court judge should be appointed as ethics officer by the BCCI to administer issues
                        relating to conflict of interest, misdemeanour and corruption.
                    </li>
                    <li>A former Supreme Court judge should be appointed ombudsman to resolve internal disputes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Transparency: Bringing RTI to BCCI</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It recommended that the Legislature must seriously consider bringing BCCI within the purview of
                        the RTI Act
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Securing player’s interest</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It recommended the setting up of a Players’ Association to safeguard the interests of the
                        cricketers.
                    </li>
                    <li>The report said players that are the driving force of the game, but they had been reduced to the
                        status of employees and subordinates of those governing the game.
                    </li>
                    <li>The idea is to give players voice, use their expertise and skills for the development and
                        betterment of the game
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Women Cricket: Often ignored by BCCI</strong></p>

                        <li>According to the current eligibility criteria, the annual income of parents of the SC

                        <li>This figure is now proposed to be revised to Rs 6 lakh per annum</li>
                        <li>The funding, available in 175 notified top institutes, covers much of the expenses incurred

                    <ul>
                        <li>For pre-matric scholarships for SC students, the annual income is proposed to be revised

                        </li>
                        <li>The ministry is also looking at revising the varying income criteria for other schemes for

                        </li>

            <ul>
                <li>Food ministry is working on a pilot to emulate the direct cooking gas subsidy transfer scheme model
                    for public distribution system (PDS) of subsidised foodgrains.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Modus operandi:</strong> The beneficiaries will get the subsidy amount in advance in their bank
                accounts and they will have to buy the foodgrains from any ration shop, which has got the electronic
                point of sale (e-PoS) devices.</p>
            <p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>This initiative will ensure zero leakage of the subsidy and foodgrain as well.</li>
                <li>The beneficiaries’ failure to buy the foodgrains from the e-PoS enabled ration shop would result in
                    no transfer of the subsidy for the next month. This will also ensure that beneficiaries under
                    National Food Security Act don’t use the subsidy amount for anything else.

            <p><strong>Elsewhere: Union Territories of Chandigarh, Puducherry and Dadra &amp; Nagar Haveli- </strong>the

                <p><strong>Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act
                    2013</strong></p>
                <p>This act was enacted in April 2013 as India’s first law dealing with the protection of women against
                    sexual harassment at workplace. Some important feature of this act are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This Act aimed to provide every woman, irrespective of her age or employment status, a safe and
                        secure working environment free from all forms of harassment.
                    </li>
                    <li>This Act covered both the organized and unorganized sectors in India. The statute applied to all
                        government bodies, private and public sector organizations, non-governmental organizations,
                        organizations carrying out commercial, vocational, educational, entertainment, industrial,
                        financial activities, hospitals etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>This Act defined ‘sexual harassment’ in line with the Supreme Court’s definition in the Vishaka
                        Judgment.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Act extended the meaning of the word sexual harassment to include “presence or occurrence of
                        circumstances of implied or explicit promise of preferential treatment in employment, threat of
                        detrimental treatment in employment, threat about present or future employment, interference
                        with work or creating an intimidating or offensive or hostile work environment, or humiliating
                        treatment likely to affect the lady employee’s health or safety could also amount to sexual
                        harassment”.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Act also introduced the concept of <strong>‘extended workplace’</strong> since sexual
                        harassment is not always confined to the primary place of employment. Therefore, the Act defined
                        ‘workplace’ to include any place visited by the employee arising out of or during the course of
                        employment, including transportation provided by the employer for the purpose of commuting to
                        and from the place of employment.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Act provided for the establishment of <strong>Internal Complaints Committee (ICC)</strong>
                        at each and every office or branches of the organization employing 10 or more employees, in
                        order to provide a forum for filing complaints to facilitate fast redressal of the grievances
                        pertaining to sexual harassment.
                    </li>
                    <li>It also provided for the establishment of <strong>local complaints committee (LCC)</strong> at
                        the district level by the Government to investigate and redress complaints of sexual harassment
                        of the unorganized sector or from those establishments where the ICC has not been constituted
                        for the reason being, it having less than 10 employees.

            <p><strong>Context: </strong>NITI Aayog’s ‘Outcome based monitoring’</p>
            <p><strong>Outcome based monitoring of NITI Aayog</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>NITI Aayog is engaged in outcome-based monitoring with states in sectors such as healthcare,
                    education and water supply
                </li>
                <li>It is also discussing the idea of ranking each state based on health, education and water index, and
                    identifying states with good performance
                </li>
                <li>For example, it has developed a composite water management index, comprising several key performance
                    indicators, with different weights assigned to indicators
                </li>
                <li>This is expected to incentivise states to collect data and analyse it to make better policies</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Possible Disadvantage of Outcome based monitoring</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Some experts suggests that owing to self-ranking by states without independent review, reforms
                    remain mostly on paper with key concerns remaining unaddressed.
                </li>
                <li>Also, legitimate beneficiaries may get excluded.</li>
                <li>Consequently, such approach of self-ranking and comparing needs to be viewed with caution.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Outcomes of efficient policy implementation by States:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Experts suggest that significant improvement in the ability to implement policies and projects in
                    the states, cities, and at the centre can considerably add to citizens’ well-being.
                </li>
                <li>And also, could even add about 2-3% to the country’s GDP, without any additional resources.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The way forward</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Agencies struggling with implementation should not be burdened with additional responsibilities of
                    data collection and analysis.
                </li>
                <li>NITI Aayog must create a repository of best practices(as a benchmark) for dealing with
                    implementation challenges, based on case studies from around the world.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) is a proposed free trade agreement (FTA)
                            between the ten member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) (Brunei,
                            Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam)
                            and the six states with which ASEAN has existing free trade agreements (Australia, China,
                            India, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand).
                        </li>
                        <li>RCEP negotiations were formally launched in November 2012 at the ASEAN Summit in Cambodia.
                        </li>
                        <li>The agreement is scheduled to be finalized by the end of 2017.</li>
                        <li>RCEP is viewed as an alternative to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a proposed trade
                            agreement which includes several Asian and American nations but excludes China and India.

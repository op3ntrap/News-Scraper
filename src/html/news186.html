            <ul>
                <li>The home ministry has asked Left Wing Extremism (LWE)-affected states to distribute 15 lakh solar
                    lamps to students in the 35 worst affected districts until all villages are electrified.
                </li>
                <li>Home Minister Rajnath Singh is learnt to have instructed states to expedite the process of
                    distributing the solar lamps so that students don’t suffer for want of electricity.
                </li>
                <li>The official said though the recruitment by Maoists has seen a declining trend, the government
                    wanted to reach out to the youth in villages.
                </li>
                <li>Home ministry has also decided to link telecom towers with optical fibres as the mobile towers were
                    unable to bear the load of many calls at one time.

            <ul>
                <li>President Ram Nath Kovind expressed concern over the <strong>“unacceptably low”</strong>
                    representation of women, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes in the
                    higher judiciary. He called for long-term measures to remedy this situation.
                </li>
                <li>He said that only 4,700 of the 17,000 judges — roughly one in four — in India were women.</li>
                <li>Kovind said all the three organs of the State — the judiciary, the executive and the legislature —
                    needed to be careful not to cross into one another’s finely defined spaces. “Public life is today a
                    glasshouse. There is a relentless demand for transparency and scrutiny. Our legal fraternity needs
                    to be mindful of these legitimate urges of the people — the ultimate masters in a democracy. All
                    three organs of the State are obligated to be models of good conduct,”
                </li>
                <li>The President said there was a need to look at <strong>alternative dispute resolution</strong></li>
                <li>Kovind said lawyer fees needed to be brought down and India’s reputation of having an expensive
                    legal system must be changed.

            </ul>
            <p><strong>Union Home Minister highlights the following issues during the meeting:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Centre and the State governments should engage in greater cooperation so that differences on
                    issues such as deployment of Central forces are resolved quickly.
                </li>
                <li>He said a number of steps had been taken in recent years by the Centre to promote cooperative
                    federalism.
                </li>
                <li>It is important for everyone to promote the spirit of cooperation with greater zeal and expressed
                    satisfaction over the deliberations held in a “harmonious and congenial” atmosphere for arriving at
                    consensus on complex issues.
                </li>
                <li>He said the standing committee is being convened to lend speed to the process of harmonising
                    Centre-State relations.
                </li>
                <li>The subjects discussed at the standing committee meeting included financial transfers from the
                    Centre to the States, Goods and Services Tax, structure and devolution of functions to local bodies
                    and district planning.

                <li>According to the new policy, residents who buy cars costing Rs 10 lakh and above will have to pay
                    50% of its price as road tax.
                </li>
                <li>If you buy a second car, irrespective of the price, you will have to pay 50% of its price.</li>
                <li>The existing policy charges 6% as road tax for vehicles costing up to Rs 20 lakh and 8% for vehicles
                    above Rs 20 lakh.
                </li>

                <li>The new draft policy also seeks to clamp down on the number of vehicles sold in one quarter. Moving
                    on, residents will have to purchase certificate of ownership/entitlement and certificate of parking
                    availability during vehcile registration will be a necessity.

                <li>Sometime in 2019 or 2020 India will send <strong>ISRO’s solar mission Aditya-L1</strong> to a
                    vantage point in space, known as <strong>the L1 Lagrange point</strong>, to do imaging and study of
                    the sun.
                </li>
                <li>This launch will happen in the early part of the next solar cycle – an occurrence in which sunspots
                    form on the face of the sun, growing in size and number and eventually diminishing, all over a
                    period of eleven years.
                </li>
                <li>It will be the first 100% Indian mission which will not only negotiate a challenging orbit, but will
                    also benefit the global scientific community in understanding the sun.
                </li>
                <li>Aditya L1 has two in situ particle-detection payloads – Aditya Solar wind Particle EXperiment
                    (ASPEX) and Plasma Analyser Package for Aditya (PAPA) will study aspects that affect space weather.
                    the origin of solar wind ions, their reaction to coronal mass ejections, the distribution of these
                    in the heliosphere – the space around the sun that extends up to Pluto – and so on. The various
                    payloads in Aditya-L1 will also study space weather.

            <ul>
                <li>The so-called L1 point is 1.5 million kilometres away. Here, due to the delicate balance of
                    gravitational forces, the satellite will require very little energy to maintain its orbit. Also it
                    will not be eclipsed from the sun. The 1,500-kg class satellite will be programmed to orbit this
                    point and image the sun’s magnetic field from space for the very first time in the world.
                </li>
                <li>Scientists hope to capture the close-ups of the sun from here, uninterrupted by eclipses for

                    which sunspots, caused by the sun’s magnetic field, start forming, increase in the ascending phase
                    and decrease in the descending phase towards the end of the cycle.

                <li>Now Mahendragiri gecko has been added to the species list of the Eastern Ghats.</li>
                <li>Discovered from Andhra Pradesh’s Mahendragiri hills, it is the second gecko to be found endemic to
                    the area. The discovery highlights the biodiversity importance of the region, say scientists.

            <p><strong>Genetics help</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Genetic analysis, which involves scrutiny of an organism’s DNA, helped scientists to discover that
                    the Dutta’s Mahendragiri geckos were not a population of Spotted rock geckos (found in the northern
                    Western Ghats in Maharashtra) as it was believed.
                </li>
                <li>DNA sequence data showed that these two geographically-separated populations are different and a
                    careful examination of their characteristics showed that the new species has many unique, diagnostic
                    characters.
                </li>
                <li>Dutta’s Mahendragiri gecko has golden eyes and pale, black-bordered horizontal bands.</li>
                <li>The lizard is the 32nd species of Hemidactylus gecko found in India.</li>

                <li>After seeking the Centre’s nod for shifting of tigers from Ranthambhore to Mukundara Hills Tiger
                    Reserve, the Rajasthan government has asked for permission to bring tigers from other States for
                    their rehabilitation and cross-mating in order to develop strong breeds of the big cat.
                </li>
                <li>The Sariska Tiger Reserve in Alwar district, where the tiger population had vanished a few years
                    ago, had brought back a significant number of big cats.
                </li>
                <li>Shifting tigers to Rajasthan would help resolve the problem of hereditary diseases among them and
                    improve their breeds through cross-mating.
                </li>
                <li>The Mukundara Hills is the third notified tiger habitat in the State, after Ranthambhore and
                    Sariska. Though it was established to cater to the spillover tiger population from Ranthambhore, the
                    majestic cat is still missing from its wildlife population.

                <ul>
                    <li>The Centre has asked the Supreme Court to debate on the <strong>special status</strong> granted
                        to the State of Jammu and Kashmir, saying it was both a sensitive and constitutional matter.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Public Interest Litigation</strong> : a PIL plea filed by a Delhi-based NGO, We the
                        Citizens, contending that the J&amp;K government, given the State’s special autonomous status
                        under <strong>Articles 35A and 370</strong>, was discriminatory against non-residents as far as
                        government jobs and real estate purchases were concerned.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>J and K government response</strong>:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The State government argued that its special status was sourced from the 1954
                                Presidential Order, which gave special rights to the State’s permanent residents.
                            </li>
                            <li>The hearing comes in the backdrop of an earlier Jammu and Kashmir High Court, which
                                ruled that <strong>Article 370</strong> assumed a place of permanence in the
                                Constitution and the feature was beyond amendment, repeal or abrogation.
                            </li>
                            <li>The court said Article 35A gave “protection” to existing laws in force in the State.

            <div id="Sports">
                <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Sports Ministry has begun the groundwork to frame a legislation to legalise online sports
                        betting in India
                    </li>
                    <li>The Sports Ministry is also likely to seek assistance from its counterparts in the UK, where
                        gambling is legal
                    </li>
                    <li>Sports Secretary Injeti Srinivas, who is currently in England, is likely to sign a Memorandum of
                        Understanding (MoU) in which online sports betting will be one of the key points
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Betting in India</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Betting is seen as a sensitive socio-political issue. More so in sports because of the
                        match-fixing and spot-fixing controversies.
                    </li>
                    <li>The issue of legalising betting gathered momentum when former Chief Justice of India R M Lodha
                        recommended that betting should be legalised in cricket
                    </li>
                    <li>Illegal betting market in India is worth $150 billion, or roughly Rs 9.6 lakh crore.</li>
                    <li>Most of it is via local bookmakers and unregulated offshore websites.</li>
                    <li>At present, betting is legal only on horse racing, and it is taxed at 28 per cent under GST.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Advantages of legalising betting in India?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It can address the issue of poor funding for sports at central and state level by making online
                        betting legal.
                    </li>
                    <li>The possibility of diverting a sizeable part of the revenue generated from betting towards the
                        ministry’s programmes is also being deliberated.
                    </li>
                    <li>It can be beneficial to the economy as well as sports overall.</li>

            </p>
            <div id="Centre’s">
                <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Central government has floated the idea of state governments enacting their own “State Aadhaar
                        Act”, on the lines of the central Act passed by Parliament last year.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The central Act makes Aadhaar mandatory for any “subsidy, benefit or service” for which the
                        expenditure is borne fully or shared partially by the Consolidated Fund of India.
                    </li>
                    <li>This means that every welfare subsidy or benefit, from fully-funded or centrally-sponsored
                        schemes (where states share part of the fiscal burden), is conditional on verification through
                        Aadhaar.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Why state Aadhaar Act</strong>?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Several state governments have their own subsidies or benefit schemes, where the burden is
                        defrayed out of their Consolidated Fund
                    </li>
                    <li>Consequently, the central Aadhaar Act cannot provide legal basis for making Aadhaar mandatory
                        for such schemes.
                    </li>
                    <li>However, a State Aadhaar Act, as suggested by the Cabinet Secretariat, could provide legal basis
                        for making it mandatory for state-funded welfare schemes
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Other concerns</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>But the Centre’s suggestion could prove tricky as the enactment of a state legislation is the
                        prerogative of the state legislatures.
                    </li>
                    <li>Also, it impinges on the state government’s autonomy to set up a mechanism for expenditure from
                        the state exchequer.
                    </li>

                <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Union Home Ministry is reworking the proposed Prevention of Destruction of Public Property
                        (PDPP) Amendment Bill to exclude provisions that hold leaders of political parties responsible
                        for such damage,
                    </li>
                    <li>The move runs contrary to the ministry’s stand in 2015, when it had argued for severe measures
                        to hold leaders of political parties accountable for damage to public property caused during
                        bandhs, protests and demonstrations called by them. It had also pushed for the parties to pay
                        the market value of property destroyed by their supporters.
                    </li>
                    <li>According to the National Crime Records Bureau, Tamil Nadu (1,671), Uttar Pradesh (1,131) and
                        Haryana (529) recorded the highest number of cases under the PDPP Act in 2015.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Reasons behind making changes in the proposed bill?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Law enforcement agencies expressed the fear that the amended law may be misused to frame
                        Opposition leaders who call for bandhs, by inciting violence and damaging property.
                    </li>
                    <li>It can be used to send their political opponents behind bars.</li>
                    <li>Plan to emphasise on improving the quality of evidence, which will require police officers to
                        record on video all protests, hartal or bandhs,
                    </li>
                    <li>The soft copies of video evidence will be deposited by the officer in charge at the local police
                        station with the sub-divisional magistrate or executive magistrate who will hand it over to the
                        investigating officer.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Bill may also include a provision to make such offences non-bailable unless “there are
                        reasonable grounds to believe that (the accused) is not guilty”.
                    </li>
                    <li>However, the provision to include “damage to private properties” is likely to be dropped in the
                        reworked Bill, since they are covered under different insurance schemes.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Supreme Court’s findings</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In 2007, the Supreme Court had asked the government to bring amendments to the PDPP Act.</li>
                    <li>While appointing a committee to examine the law, the apex court had observed in 2009: “In almost
                        all such cases, top leaders of such organisations who really instigate such direct actions will
                        keep themselves in the background, and only the ordinary or common members or grassroot-level
                        followers directly participate, and they alone would be vulnerable to prosecution proceedings.”

                    <li>China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has held “<strong>live-fire drills</strong>” in Tibet,
                        close to the India’s border in Arunachal, to practice quick movement of troops and destroy enemy
                        aircraft.
                    </li>
                    <li>The drill is being seen as a message to the Indian government and military, as China claims

                        <p><strong>Food wastage in India</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Food wastage means, Food is lost or wasted throughout the supply chain, from initial
                                agricultural production to final household consumption. The losses, represent “a waste
                                of resources used in production such as land, water, energy and inputs, increasing the
                                green gas emissions in vain”.
                            </li>
                            <li>According FAO, “One third of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted
                                globally, which amounts to about 1.3 billion tons per year.
                            </li>
                            <li>India ranked 97th among 118 countries in the Global Hunger Index for 2016</li>
                            <li>According to one estimate, 21 million tonnes of wheat are wasted in India every year
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Reasons behind food-wastage?</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It can be linked to people’s behaviour.</li>
                            <li>Absence of an effective distribution mechanism and legal framework.</li>
                            <li>Due to food’s perishability.</li>
                            <li>Poor supply-chain management, results in significant wastage, both at pre- and
                                post-harvest stages
                            </li>
                            <li>A recent study by the IIM, Calcutta, revealed that only 10% of food is covered by cold
                                storage facilities in India
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Food wastage has multiple socio-economic and environmental impacts.</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Social</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Wastage of food is not less than a social delinquency.</li>
                            <li>Though hunger cannot be tackled directly by preventing food wastage, food that is wasted
                                in our country can feed many hungry people.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Environmental</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The increasing wastage results in land degradation by about 45%, mainly due to
                                deforestation, unsustainable agricultural practices, and excessive groundwater
                                extraction.
                            </li>
                            <li>The energy spent over wasted food results in 3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide
                                production every year.
                            </li>
                            <li>Decay also leads to harmful emission of other gases in the atmosphere; for instance,
                                decaying of rice produces methane.
                            </li>
                            <li>Food waste emissions have a major impact on climate change and result in greater carbon

                            <li>Such initiatives, creating networks and channels of distribution between those who have
                                surplus food and those who are in need of them, are necessary.

                                turned into an advantage instead of resulting in wastage.

                            <li>The government can create a time-bound task force under Niti Aayog, with experts from
                                different sectors, to frame a national policy to address the issue, which can recommend

                                <p>The Sakewa festival of Rai Community has recently celebrated in Sikkim as a tribute
                                    to Mother Nature. The fest is also known as Bhoomi Puja or Chandi Puja or worship of
                                    land. This festival is marked with the performing of puja where prayers are offered
                                    to the Supreme Power for Peace and Protection and for the well-being of all the
                                    living and non-living things of the universe. Apart from this, Buddha Purnima is
                                    also celebrated in Sikkim as the day marked the birth of Gautam Buddha and also the
                                    day on which he attained Nirvana under the Mahabodhi tree at Bodh Gaya. The people
                                    visited monasteries and listen sermons across the state. Most monks have spent the
                                    day reading scriptures before the statue of the Buddha.<span/></p></div>

                                    reality for the small town common man. The Civil Aviation Minister Shri P Ashok
                                    Gajapathi Raju launched the Ministry’s much awaited Regional Connectivity Scheme
                                    “UDAN” (“Ude Desh Ka Aam Naagrik”) in New Delhi today. UDAN is an innovative scheme
                                    to develop the regional aviation market. It is a market-based mechanism in which
                                    airlines bid for seat subsidies. This first-of-its-kind scheme globally will create
                                    affordable yet economically viable and profitable flights on regional routes so that
                                    flying becomes affordable to the common man even in small towns.”</p></div>

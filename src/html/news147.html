                    proceedings are hardly audible for lawyers, litigants and even the media present in the courtrooms
                    as judges do not to switch on the microphones kept before them.

            <ul>
                <li>Under the <strong>“open court” system of administration of justice</strong>, the public should get
                    reasonable access to courtrooms so that they could hear as well as watch the proceedings

                <li><strong>Number of deaths in 2015: </strong>2.51 million, India had been ranked the No.1 in pollution
                    related deaths.

                <li>China recorded the second highest number of such deaths (1.8 million).</li>
                <li>India accounted for about 28 per cent of an estimated nine million pollution linked deaths worldwide
                    in 2015.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Leading cause of deaths in 2015:</strong> air pollution accounting for 6.5 million premature
                    deaths.
                </li>
                <li>Among the world’s 10 most populous countries, the largest increase in numbers of pollution related
                    deaths were seen in <strong>India and Bangladesh.</strong> But the absolute number of air pollution
                    deaths in Bangladesh was only 0.2 million. <img class=" wp-image-42877 alignright"

        <div id="Spain moves to suspend Catalonia’s autonomy">
            <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Spain said it will move to seize some of the Catalan regional government’s powers after its leader
                    warned that he could declare independence, escalating the country’s worst political crisis in
                    decades.
                </li>
                <li>The central government in Madrid had given separatist leader Carles Puigdemont time until 10:00 am
                    to say whether or not he was declaring a breakaway state in the semi-autonomous region following a
                    chaotic referendum on October 1.
                </li>
                <li>Prime Minister of Spain had warned he would trigger Article 155 of Spain’s Constitution a never
                    before used measure allowing it to impose direct rule over the wealthy northeastern region unless
                    Mr. Puigdemont backed down.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Impact of this decision:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>There are fears that such a move, allowing Madrid to potentially suspend Mr. Puigdemont’s government
                    and take over its police force, could spark unrest in a region where even Catalans who oppose
                    independence cherish their autonomy highly.
                </li>
                <li>The separatist leader responded that Catalan lawmakers could vote to declare secession unilaterally
                    if Madrid triggers Article 155.
                </li>
                <li>Article 155 a process that would take several days to restore legality in the region.</li>
                <li>The Catalonia crisis has prompted a series of huge street rallies, worried investors and added to
                    the woes of a European Union already grappling with Brexit.
                </li>
                <li>Catalonia’s 7.5 million residents are fiercely attached to their own language and culture but are
                    divided on whether to break away from the rest of Spain.
                </li>
                <li>But according to the separatist leader his regional administration has a mandate to declare
                    independence from what he says was a 90% “Yes” vote on October 1.
                </li>
                <li>But turnout was given as only 43%.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Many voters who oppose independence stayed away from a referendum that had been declared illegal by
                Spain’s Constitutional Court.</p>

                <li>The <strong>Logistics Data Bank’s (LDB)</strong> services will soon be extended to all major ports
                    in India.
                </li>
                <li><strong>The LDB project’s</strong> <strong>objective: </strong>to ensure greater efficiency in the
                    country’s logistics sector through the use of information technology.

            <ul>
                <li>Discussions between the Government and the <strong>Indian Ports Association</strong> (IPA) in this
                    regard have begun.
                </li>
                <li>The IPA is the apex body for India’s major ports under the shipping ministry’s supervisory control.
                    Until now, the LDB project covered only the country’s western logistics corridor.
                </li>
                <li>As part of the LDB project, each container is attached to a <strong>Radio Frequency Identification
                    Tag (RFID) tag</strong> and tracked through RFID readers. This, in turn, helps importers and
                    exporters to track their goods in transit.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Background information:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The LDB project was unveiled in July 2016 as an important <strong>‘ease of doing business’
                    initiative</strong> to boost the country’s foreign trade and bring about greater transparency.
                </li>
                <li>It helps reduce the overall lead time of container movement, besides bringing down transaction costs
                    that consignees and shippers incur.
                </li>
                <li>The project is implemented through a <strong>Special Purpose Vehicle called Delhi Mumbai Industrial
                    Corridor Development Corporation Logistics Data Services Ltd. (DLDSL)</strong> — jointly (50:50)
                    owned by the Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) Trust and Japanese IT services major NEC
                    Corporation.
                </li>
                <li>The LDB project covers “the entire movement through rail or road till the Inland Container Depot and
                    Container Freight Station.”
                </li>
                <li>The DLDSL so far provides “container tracking services to around 70% of the container traffic in
                    India.”
                </li>
                <li>The services include providing users the ‘average delivery time’ as well as notifications through
                    SMS and email.
                </li>
                <li>The LDB project also provides other services such as ‘congestion and bottleneck analysis’ as well as
                    ‘performance bench-marking’ that aids the users to pinpoint supply chain inefficiencies, and in turn
                    help improve the system.

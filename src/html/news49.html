                <li>A <strong>nine-judge Bench</strong> of the Supreme Court will hear the question <strong>whether
                    privacy is a fundamental human right and is part of the basic structure of the
                    Constitution.</strong></li>

                        <li>The Aadhaar scheme, is a violation of the citizens’ <strong>right to privacy</strong>.</li>
                        <li>The petitioners have argued that right to privacy is part of <strong>Article 21</strong>,
                            the right to life, and interspersed in <strong>Article 19</strong>, though not explicitly
                            stated in the Constitution.

                </li>
                <li>Rajasthan High Court vide order dated 31.5.2017 advised that cow should be declared a national

                    conservation of cows and for declaring cow as a national animal.

            <p><strong>Key Fact:</strong> Under the distribution of legislative powers between Union of India and states
                under article 246(3) of the Constitution, the preservation of cattle is a matter on which the

            <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare’s plan to eliminate malaria by 2027.</li>
                <li>It aims to eradicate the mosquito-borne disease from India <strong>three years ahead of</strong> the
                    <strong>global deadline</strong> set by the <strong>World Health Organisation (WHO).</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>New plan approach</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is the country’s first time-bound malaria elimination programme since the National Malaria
                    Eradication Programme was aborted in the late 1960s.
                </li>
                <li>Since the 1970s, the thrust of India’s anti-malaria programme has been on controlling the disease.
                </li>
                <li>The National Vector and Disease Control Progamme, 2004, the plan’s predecessor, too aimed at
                    “controlling” malaria.
                </li>
                <li>There are time-bound targets for all districts, based on their vulnerability to malaria.</li>
                <li>The plan lays emphasis on awareness programmes, entomological surveillance and outbreak warning
                    systems — methods that have contributed to eradicating malaria in several parts of the world,
                    including Sri Lanka.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Challenges </strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Manpower shortage which has virtually crippled a large number of the country’s primary health
                    centres.
                </li>
                <li>This shortage not only jeopardises early detection and treatment of the disease, but is also a cause
                    for a large number of cases going unreported.
                </li>
                <li>Under-reporting of malaria makes it difficult to accurately estimate the burden of the disease.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>India’s Vulnerability to malaria</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Malaria parasite has been particularly resilient for centuries.</li>
                <li><strong>Plasmodium vivax parasite</strong> responsible for almost 50 per cent of India’s malaria
                    burden has adapted to anti-malarial drugs.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Way forward</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Compared to several other communicable diseases, malaria is not a particularly complex disease. What
                    we need to do is to stop mosquitoes from transmitting the parasite or make the parasite ineffective.

                <ul>
                    <li>The Union Cabinet is expected to approve a bill that, mandates a <strong>universal minimum
                        wage.</strong></li>
                    <li>The code empowers <strong>the Centre to set a minimum wage</strong> to help poor, unskilled
                        workers earn more.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Problems with minimum wage</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Economists warned that price floors prevent the available supply of goods from being fully
                        sold.
                    </li>
                    <li>So, the minimum wage would logically hurt workers by increasing unemployment</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Minimum wage and unemployment:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Famous 1993 study by David Card and Alan B. Krueger found that a rise in the minimum wage in New
                        Jersey actually decreased unemployment.
                    </li>
                    <li>“Seattle’s Minimum Wage Experience 2015-16”, a 2017 found that since the city raised its minimum
                        wage in 2015, unemployment dropped from 4.3% to 3.3%.
                    </li>
                    <li>Since then, a flurry of studies has concluded that a minimum wage has either no, or very little,
                        negative effect on employment.
                    </li>
                    <li>But another paper, found that employment among the youth in Denmark decreased by one-third when
                        they attained the age at which their minimum wage increases by 40%.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The real effect:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The minimum wage increases unemployment, except when it is set below the market price for
                        labour; or only marginally higher, in which case the minimum wage enhances the bargaining power

                    </li>
                    <li>But figuring out, and also periodically adjusting, the wage rate at which the worker benefits is
                        often impractical.

                <p><strong>Other effects of minimum wage?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Even when it looks like the minimum wage has no negative effect on employment; it can have other
                        unintended effects.
                    </li>
                    <li>Companies, for example, instead of firing workers, may employ them for fewer hours, which in
                        turn will affect the quality of their services
                    </li>
                    <li>“Minimum Wage and Restaurant Hygiene Violation”, a 2017 paper found that hygiene violations by
                        restaurants increased significantly after a rise in the minimum wage as the restaurants tried to
                        cut down on cleaning-staff expenses.

                <ul>
                    <li>‘Hyperglobalisation’ has been used to describe the dramatic increase in international trade
                        witnessed for about a decade and a half from the early 1990s up to the global financial crisis
                        of 2008
                    </li>
                    <li>The imagery intended is one of an increasing connectedness among nations leading to a virtuous
                        cycle of economic expansion
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>History of Globalisation</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Starting some time in the last quarter of the 19th century, for close to 50 years, the world saw
                        an expansion in trade that was actually as great or even greater than during the recently
                        concluded phase
                    </li>
                    <li>Then had also occurred an unprecedented movement of capital and of people</li>
                    <li>British capital flowed into building the railways across the world, immigrants moved from Europe
                        to the United States and Asian labour was moved to the sites of deployment of western capital
                    </li>
                    <li>The phase of high trade starting 1870 came to an end with the First World War and was to revive,
                        slowly, only after the Second
                    </li>
                    <li>Then, following the collapse of East European communism in the early 1990s, there was a
                        resurgence in global trade
                    </li>
                    <li>Now even this phase has somewhat abruptly ended with the global financial crisis</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Role of technology</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>19th century globalisation was underpinned by technological advances that facilitated trade</li>
                    <li>It may as well be said that trade expanded as the demand for goods grew</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The slowdown and India</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the world economy is set to grow slowly for the foreseeable future, a premise of much of the
                        economic policy in India since 1991 would have to be replaced
                    </li>
                    <li>The shift that has taken place is most visible in the IT industry</li>
                    <li>Now, “bricks and mortar” is no longer something to be spurned and soiling our hands may be part
                        of the business of earning our living for some time to come
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>What does India need to do?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Recognising the diminished tempo of globalisation, India’s economic policymakers must address
                        the growth of the home market
                    </li>
                    <li>This means increasing the demand for goods and services emanating from within the country</li>
                    <li>There is a case for cutting the repo rate now, but its effects are doubtful</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Way forward</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Independently of the ‘twin balance sheet problem’, Keynesian economics has long recognised that
                        lowering the rate of interest may not do much for private investment if the expected rate of
                        return is depressed
                    </li>
                    <li>The slowing of both global trade and domestic manufacturing may have had precisely this effect
                        by lowering the long-term expectations held by private investors
                    </li>
                    <li>Buoying up of flagging demand can be done through public investment</li>
                    <li>Infrastructure is unique in that spending on it raises aggregate demand and when it actually
                        comes on stream, it raises the productivity of investment elsewhere in the economy
                    </li>
                    <li>‘Roads and bridges’ are a metaphor for the public infrastructure that the Indian economy can
                        fruitfully absorb today
                    </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Fiji, which is the president of the conference, wants all countries to upwardly revise their
                        targets ahead of climate change negotiations under the Paris climate agreement which begins in
                        the German city Bonn, as the latest data shows that carbon emissions in 2016 was the highest
                        ever.
                    </li>
                    <li>The proposal has been backed by out-going president Morocco.</li>
                    <li>197 countries will discuss the rules for operationalizing the climate accord that aims to
                        restrict temperature rise by 2-degree Celsius to the pre-industrial levels by 2100.
                    </li>
                    <li>As US is out of Paris Climate Agreement, India should take it as an opportunity and a call for
                        great and more ambitious action, not a call for inaction.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>INDIA REPORT CARD</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Positives :-</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>India’s installed solar capacity has increased three-fold to 13.4 GegaWatts (GW) since the Paris
                        deal was signed in 2015.
                    </li>
                    <li>Renewable including hydro and wind, has become a sunshine sector for India with the installed
                        capacity of over 58 GW by end of last fiscal, which is among the top five countries in the
                        world.
                    </li>
                    <li>India is on track to meet its target of generating 40% of the energy from renewable sources by
                        2030 and to meet its target of reducing emission to GDP ratio called emission intensity by 33%
                        by 2030 of the 2005 level. By 2016, the emission intensity reduction recorded was 18%.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Negatives :-</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>India’s increasing dependence on coal to meet its energy needs still remains a concern for the
                        global climate community. Around 59% of the total electricity generated in India is powered by
                        coal.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>ISSUES AT BONN :-</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pre-2020 Agenda:</strong> The developing world will seek a status report from the rich
                        nations on their promise to mobilise US $100 billion a year from 2020 for rest of the world to
                        fight climate change and to enhance emission reduction targets. The developing nations say the
                        rich nations are far away from meeting these targets.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Facilitative Dialogue 2018:</strong> This will thresh out key issues such as a
                        transparent mechanism to review targets under the Paris agreement, when the targets need to be
                        enhanced and how. Developing countries do not want review of the targets already decided,
                        especially for climate change causing rich nations.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Finance:</strong> Finance has been a bone of contention between the developed and the
                        developing world with rich nations not willing to provide access to technology to address
                        climate change. The Green Climate Fund set up to provide clean technology impetus to the
                        developing world has not fully taken off and there is no clarity on how compensation mechanism
                        called loss and damage will be operationalised.

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Arunachal Pradesh</strong> — issued by the secretary (political) of the Government
                            of Arunachal Pradesh. It is required for entering Arunachal Pradesh through any of the check
                            gates across the interstate border with Assam or Nagaland.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Mizoram </strong>— Issued by the Government of Mizoram. It is required for entering
                            Mizoram through any of the check gates across the inter-State borders.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Nagaland </strong>— Issued by the Government of Nagaland. It is mandatory for Indian
                            citizens of other states entering Nagaland through any of the check gates across the
                            interstate borders. Dimapur, Nagaland’s largest city and porthead, is the only place in the
                            state which does not require an ILP, and Indians arriving by air at Dimapur Airport can
                            arrive and stay in the city without one.

                    <p>India’s first micro forest will be built in Raipur, Chattisgarh. Approximately, 19 acres of land
                        which housed around 70 government office buildings will be converted into micro forest in order
                        to create an oxy-zone. The micro forest will provide fresh air to Raipur which is the 7th most
                        polluted city in the world. It will reportedly be open to the public in the next 8 months.</p>

                    <p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
                    <p>‘Rayichapalu’ has been officially declared as one of the rarest species of fish in the world by
                        the researchers from the Marine Living Resources Department of Andhra University. The fish is a
                        regular catch for fishermen in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. It is a colourful fish which is
                        around 97mm in length and lives near the reefs. The researchers stated that this fish has a
                        unique colour pattern with spectacular diamond shaped bands. Reportedly, it is the only fifth
                        fish in this category of size. Now, the tiny colourful fish will have the scientific name
                        ‘Pseudathias Vizagensis’, after the city where it was first discovered.</p></div>

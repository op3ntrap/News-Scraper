                    <p><strong>National Song</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The song Vande Mataram, composed in Sanskrit by Bankimchandra Chatterjee, was a source of
                            inspiration to the people in their struggle for freedom. It has an equal status with
                            Jana-gana-mana. The first political occasion when it was sung was the 1896 session of the
                            Indian National Congress.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This act is applicable in whole of India (including Jammu &amp; Kashmir) and it prohibits
                            the desecration of or insult to the National Flag, Constitution, National Anthem, India’s
                            Map etc.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Provisions Regarding National Flag and Constitution: </strong>This act makes
                            provision that whoever burns, mutilates, destroys, disfigures or otherwise shows disrespect
                            to India’s National Flag or Constitution shall be punished with an imprisonment (max-3
                            years) or a fine or both. The definition of Indian Flag included any picture, drawing,
                            photograph or any other visible representation.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>How the above provisions are related to Flag Code of India 2002?</strong>Display of
                            National Flag is governed by the provisions of two acts viz. Emblems and Names (Prevention
                            of Improper Use) Act, 1950 and Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971. Further,
                            the government also issues non-statutory instructions from time to time. The Flag Code of
                            India brings these laws, conventions and other instructions together and serves as a single
                            reference point about how to properly hoist flag of India with due honour. The Flag Code of
                            India itself is not an act of parliament.<br/> <strong>How provisions of IPC are related to
                                disrespect to National Anthem?</strong>Disrespect to national insignia has been linked
                            to Section 124(A) of IPC, which refers to sedition. This section was slapped on few people
                            in Kerala who failed to stand while National Anthem was being played in a theatre.
                            Similarly, a youth was arrested under Section 66-A of the IT Act in 2014 {this section is
                            now null and void} for posting a picture of National Flag with a derogatory comment on it on
                            Facebook.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Provisions Regarding National Anthem:</strong> The section 3 of the Prevention of
                            Insults to National Honour Act says that whoever intentionally prevents the singing of
                            National Anthem or causes any disturbance in such singing shall be punished with
                            imprisonment (max 3 years) or a fine or both.
                        </li>

        <div id="What’s">
            <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A resurgent Gorkhaland movement and subsequent state crackdown have infused life with violent
                    uncertainty.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What triggered the issue?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>In May, the West Bengal government announced Bengali as a compulsory language in schools across the
                    State.
                </li>
                <li>This triggered protests and claims of ‘linguistic imperialism’ in the Darjeeling and Kalimpong
                    districts.
                </li>
                <li>Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee then decided to hold a Cabinet meeting in Darjeeling for the first
                    time in over 40 years.
                </li>
                <li>But representatives of the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA) or the three hill MLAs, were
                    not included, eliciting protests.
                </li>
                <li>Subsequent protests and crackdowns have led to further destruction and deaths.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Gorkhaland</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Gorkhaland movement is a long-standing quest for a separate State of Gorkhaland within India for
                    Nepali-speaking Indian citizens (often known as ‘Gorkhas’).
                </li>
                <li>Gorkhaland is a classic sub-nationalist movement, similar to those that have produced other States
                    like Telangana, Uttarakhand etc.
                </li>
                <li>Gorkhaland is a desire for the recognition, respect, and integration of Gorkha peoples in the Indian
                    nation-state.
                </li>
                <li>The movement is neither separatist nor anti-nationalist; it is about inclusion and belonging in
                    India.
                </li>
                <li>It stands as a key means to redress the Gorkhas’ enduring history of discrimination, misconception,
                    and marginalisation in India.
                </li>
                <li>By demanding Gorkhaland, the people of Darjeeling-Kalimpong are opting out of West Bengal’s
                    domination, and opting in to the democratic frameworks of India.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Gorkhas hardships on many fronts</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Gorkhas remain pegged to the lowest levels of employment.</li>
                <li>Outsiders own the tea industry, and profits flow out of the hills.</li>
                <li>Gorkhas face discrimination when they seek education and work in places like Kolkata, Bengaluru, and
                    New Delhi. Called ‘foreigners’, ‘outsiders’ and ‘chinkys’, racial discrimination affects aspiring
                    Gorkhas at every turn.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Reasons for resurgence</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Since 1947, the Darjeeling-Kalimpong region has remained under West Bengal, despite no substantive
                    pre-Partition evidence to support West Bengal’s territorial claims to this region.
                </li>
                <li>Conciliatory set-ups like the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (1988-2012) and the GTA (2012-present)
                    have failed to provide meaningful autonomy.
                </li>
                <li>Banerjee and others stridently lay claim to Darjeeling, insisting that Bengal will never be
                    divided.
                </li>
                <li>Imposition of compulsory Bengali is an extensions of histories of domination that the Gorkhas are
                    trying to escape.
                </li>
                <li>West Bengal’s recent creation of the Kalimpong district (2017) and the State’s doling out of Tribal
                    Development Boards to ethnicities within the Gorkha conglomerate (Tamang, Sherpa, etc.) might appear
                    as paving the way for the TMC’s electoral gains.
                </li>
                <li>These seems clear examples of ‘divide and rule’ — causing splits in the Gorkha electorate and
                    undermining the already-limited authority of the GTA.
                </li>
                <li>By summoning thousands to the streets, the GJM (Gorkha Janmukti Morcha) demonstrated its ability to
                    evoke the emotional force of Gorkhaland. But then violence took hold.
                </li>
                <li>For Gorkhas, the troubling realities of colonial and present-day Darjeeling are eerily similar:
                    linguistic chauvinism, ethnic and racial discrimination, resource extraction, unilateral territorial
                    claims, the denial of self-governance, political suppression; and ultimately, an unwillingness to
                    respect the ‘native point of view’.

            <ul>
                <li>The newly introduced Article 279A describes Council’s decisions as “recommendations”(advisory).</li>
                <li>Due to this advisory recommendations, States can choose to ignore the council’s advice, by levying
                    additional tax not only on the sale of goods but also on services and manufacturing.

                <li>On the other hand, if these recommendations are treated as obligatory, we are left with a situation
                    where States would have altogether surrendered their fiscal autonomy to the Central government.

                <td>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Admiralty (Jurisdiction and Settlement of Maritime Claims) Bill, 2016 was introduced in
                            Lok Sabha on November 21, 2016 by the Minister of State for Shipping, Mr. Mansukh Mandaviya.
                            The Bill seeks to consolidate the existing laws on civil matters of admiralty jurisdiction
                            of courts, admiralty proceedings on maritime claims, and arrest of ships.  Admiralty laws
                            deal with cases of accidents in navigable waters or involve contracts related to commerce on
                            such waters.  The Bill repeals laws such as the Admiralty Court Act, 1861, the Colonial
                            Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890.  Key features of the Bill include:
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Admiralty jurisdiction:</strong> The jurisdiction with respect to maritime claims
                            under the Bill will vest with the respective High Courts and will extend up to the
                            territorial waters of their respective jurisdictions.  The central government may extend the
                            jurisdiction of these High Courts.  Currently admiralty jurisdiction applies to the Bombay,
                            Calcutta and Madras High Courts.  The Bill further extend this to the High Courts of
                            Karnataka, Gujarat, Orissa, Kerala, Hyderabad, and any other High Court notified by the
                            central government.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Maritime claims:</strong> The High Courts may exercise jurisdiction on maritime
                            claims arising out of conditions including: (i) disputes regarding ownership of a vessel,
                            (ii) disputes between co-owners of a vessel regarding employment or earnings of the vessel,
                            (iii) mortgage on a vessel, (iv) construction, repair, or conversion of the vessel, (v)
                            disputes arising out of the sale of a vessel, (vi) environmental damage caused by the
                            vessel, etc.  The Bill defines a vessel as any ship, boat, or sailing vessel which may or
                            may not be mechanically propelled.
                        </li>
                        <li>While determining maritime claims under the specified conditions, the courts may settle any
                            outstanding accounts between parties with regard to the vessel. They may also direct that
                            the vessel or a share of it be sold.  With regard to a sale, courts may determine the title
                            to the proceeds of such sale.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Priority of maritime claims:</strong> Among all claims in an admiralty proceeding,
                            highest priority will be given to maritime claims, followed by mortgages on the vessel, and
                            all other claims.  Within maritime claims, the highest priority will be given to claims for
                            wages due with regard to employment on the vessel.  This would be followed by claims with
                            regard to loss of life or personal injury in connection with the operation of the vessel. 
                            Such claims will continue to exist even with the change of ownership of the vessel.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Jurisdiction over a person:</strong> Courts may exercise admiralty jurisdiction
                            against a person with regard to maritime claims.  However, the courts will not entertain
                            complaints against a person in certain cases.  These include: (i) damage, or loss of life,
                            or personal injury arising out of collision between vessels that was caused in India, or
                            (ii) non-compliance with the collision regulations of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 by a
                            person who does not reside or carry out business in India.  Further, Courts will not
                            entertain action against a person until any case against them with regard to the same
                            incident in any court outside India has ended.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Arrest of vessel:</strong> The courts may order for the arrest of any vessel within
                            their jurisdiction for providing security against a maritime claim which is the subject of a
                            proceeding.  They may do so under various reasons such as: (i) owner of the vessel is liable
                            for the claim, (ii) the claim is based on mortgage of the vessel, and (iii) the claim
                            relates to ownership of the vessel, etc.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Appeals:</strong> Any judgments made by a single Judge of the High Court can be
                            appealed against to a Division Bench of the High Court.  Further, the Supreme Court may, on
                            application by any party, transfer an admiralty proceeding at any stage from one High Court
                            to any other High Court.  The latter High Court will proceed with the matter from the stage
                            where it stood at the time of the transfer.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Assessors:</strong><span>  The central government will appoint a list of assessors qualified and experienced in admiralty and maritime matters.  The central government will also determine the duties of assessors, and their fee.  Typically, assessors assist the judges in determining rates and claims in admiralty proceedings.</span>

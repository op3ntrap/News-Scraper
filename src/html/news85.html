                        nine-judge Constitution Bench verdict.
                    </li>

                        sharing of personal data in Aadhar cards to the cases of homosexuality (possibly)
                    </li>
                    <li>The SC has overruled its earlier verdictswhich held that right to privacy was not protected by
                        the Constitution

                    <li>Natural rights like privacy exist equally in all individuals, irrespective of class, strata,

                    <li>Central executive claimed against the acknowledgment of privacy as a fundamental right but
                        assured the court that it would be safeguarded through parliamentary statutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>Nevertheless, the court held that privacy is not an absolute right. The government can introduce
                        a law, which “intrudes” into privacy for public and legitimate state reasons.
                    </li>
                    <li>A person can challenge this law in any of the constitutional courts of the land for violation of
                        his fundamental right to privacy.

                <ul>
                    <li>After 30 years of removal of illegal prawn enclosures, endangered dolphins spotted back in the
                        Chilka.
                    </li>
                    <li>This move by the Chilika Development Authority’s (CDA) has resulted to unhindered movement of
                        the dolphins.
                    </li>
                    <li>CDA cleared almost 4,000 hectare of encroachment from a portion of the lake.</li>
                    <li>Satellite imageries found 14,590 hectare of the lagoon under manmade gheries (enclosures) for
                        illegal prawn cultivation.

                <ul>
                    <li>The total population of these dolphins in the world is estimated to be less than 7,500.
                        Bangladesh reports the highest count with 6400.
                    </li>
                    <li>The population in Chilka is considered to be the highest single lagoonal.</li>

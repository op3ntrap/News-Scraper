            <ul>
                <li>President Ram Nath Kovind suggested that a system be evolved for providing certified copies of High
                    Court judgments translated in<strong> local or regional languages of the litigants.</strong></li>
                <li>Copies of the translated judgments could be provided in 24 or 36 hours after the verdict was
                    pronounced.
                </li>
                <li>The President pointed out that the High Courts delivered judgments in English, “but we are a country
                    of diverse languages. The litigant may not be conversant with English and the finer points of the
                    judgment may escape him or her. The litigating parties will thus be dependent on the lawyer or
                    another person to translate the judgment. This can add to time and cost”.
                </li>
                <li>It was important not only to take justice to the people but also to make it understandable to the
                    litigating parties in a language they know

            <ul>
                <li>Days before the Gujarat Assembly elections were announced, the State government renewed its bid to
                    revive the controversial <strong>Gujarat Control of Terrorism and Organised Crime (GCTOC) Bill,
                        2015</strong>, which authorises police officers to tap phones and submit the conversations as
                    evidence in court.
                </li>
                <li>The Bill includes provisions to file a charge sheet within 180 days instead of the usual 90 and
                    proposes stricter conditions for granting bail.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Inter-ministerial review:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Union Home Ministry has sent the Bill for inter-ministerial consultations, the fifth time since
                    it was first conceived in 2003 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat.
                </li>
                <li>Former President Pranab Mukherjee had refused to clear the Bill, following which the Home Ministry
                    recalled it in January 2016.
                </li>
                <li>The Ministry asked the State government for clarifications, and Gujarat had sent a fresh proposal
                    this September.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Earlier attempts:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The earlier <strong>GUJCOC Bill</strong> was reintroduced as <strong>GCTOC Bill in 2015</strong>.
                    The same year the Information and Technology Ministry objected to the provisions that allowed
                    “authorisation of interception of telephonic conversations and their admissibility as evidence in
                    the court of law”.
                </li>
                <li>As per norms, agencies such as the Research &amp; Analysis Wing (RAW), the Directorate of Revenue
                    Intelligence, the Enforcement Directorate and the police can tap phones only with the permission of
                    the Union Home Secretary.
                </li>
                <li>The Bill in its earlier form was rejected thrice by two former Presidents — the late A.P.J. Abdul
                    Kalam in 2004 and by Pratibha Patil in 2008 and 2009.
                </li>
                <li>One of the provisions to which objections were raised by the Centre was Section 25, which provided
                    immunity to the State from any legal action for “anything which is in good faith done or intended to
                    be done in pursuance of this Act.”

            <ul>
                <li>India has rejected an offer from Pakistan for talks on transit trade to Afghanistan.</li>
                <li>According to sources, the offer was made by the Pakistan Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed
                    when he met President Ashraf Ghani on October 1 in Kabul.
                </li>
                <li>During discussions on the renewal of the <strong>Afghanistan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement
                    (APTTA), </strong>that lapsed in 2015, President Ghani repeated concerns that trade with India over
                    the Wagah border had been blocked by Pakistan, despite being agreed to in the APTTA.
                </li>
                <li>Days later, Indian officials at the <strong>SCO Afghanistan-Contact group</strong> meeting in
                    Moscow, told the Afghan delegation that it would not take up the offer for talks.
                </li>
                <li>Pakistan has consistently refused to allow any Indian goods to travel over land Afghanistan,
                    insisting that India use the sea-route via Karachi.
                </li>
                <li>Exasperated by Pakistan’s refusal to allow the truck trade, President Ghani has said repeatedly that
                    he would cut off Pakistan’s access to Central Asia and issued a decree last week cancelling
                    permission for Pakistani trucks to transit through Afghanistan.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>New routes: </strong></p>
            <p>India and Afghanistan are now working on strengthening alternative routes, including the air cargo
                corridor launched in June this year, and the Chabahar sea route.</p>

            <p><strong>In news</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stressing that food being served under the mid-day meal scheme and Integrated Child Development
                    Scheme (ICDS) do not guarantee the protein intake as envisaged, the National Human Rights Commission
                    (NHRC) has recommended to state governments and the Ministry of Women and Child Development to
                    introduce eggs and milk as part of the meal in all states.
                </li>
                <li>The recommendation was made during a conference organised by the NHRC on the implementation of the
                    National Food Security Act, 2013 on Friday.
                </li>
                <li>Malnutrition continues to haunt India despite economic growth and the mid day meal scheme and the
                    ICDS are the two biggest nutrition programmes.
                </li>
                <li>While the meal is supplied in schools, the ICDS aims at providing supplementary nutrition through
                    anganwadi centres to children aged below 6 years, besides pregnant and lactating women.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The recommendations of the NHRC</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>For the ICDS scheme, it has been recommended that adequate food testing facilities be created
                    preferably at the district level by all states through the public health department, universities
                    and colleges.
                </li>
                <li>For the meal scheme, it was recommended that social audit and evaluation by a third party be
                    conducted annually for each district and the reports be published on state portals.
                </li>
                <li>It also said that no child should be deprived of the meal because of non-linking of Aadhaar.</li>
                <li>The NHRC also questioned the state governments whether they have strictly followed Supreme Court
                    orders banning contractors in supplying nutrition under ICDS and also whether adequate funds have
                    been made available for full implementation of the Maternity Benefit Scheme or not.
                </li>
                <li>Moreover, experts said cash transfers instead of hot cooked meals may be counterproductive and must
                    not be encouraged as cash can be used for other expenditure.
                </li>
                <li>Citing Kerala and Tamil Nadu as examples, the states were asked to resolve infrastructural gaps in
                    terms of buildings, kitchens, drinking water supply and toilets within three years, by sourcing
                    funds from different schemes and departments.

            <p><strong>About</strong> <strong>the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild
                Animals:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals — more commonly abbreviated
                    to just the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) or the Bonn Convention — aims to conserve
                    terrestrial, marine and avian migratory species throughout their range. It is an international
                    treaty, concluded under the aegis of the United Nations Environment Programme, concerned with the
                    conservation of wildlife and habitats on a global scale
                </li>
                <li>Since the Convention’s entry into force, its membership has grown steadily to include over 120
                    Parties from Africa, Central and South America, Asia, Europe and Oceania.
                </li>
                <li>The Convention was signed in 1979 in Bad Godesberg, a suburb of Bonn (hence the name), and entered
                    into force in 1983. The depositary is the government of the Federal Republic of Germany.
                </li>
                <li>The CMS is the only global and UN-based intergovernmental organization established exclusively for
                    the conservation and management of terrestrial, aquatic and avian migratory species throughout their
                    range. CMS and its daughter agreements determine policy and provide further guidance on specific
                    issues through their Strategic Plans, Action Plans, resolutions, decisions and guidelines. All
                    maintain on their websites a list of all decisions taken, guidelines issues and Action Plans adopted
                    by the Member States.

                <p><strong>Explanation</strong> </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Even though known as brain corals, they do not possess a biological brain.</li>
                    <li>Found in the Caribbean, Atlantic, and Pacific Oceans, brain corals display what is known as
                        Meandroid tissue integration.
                    </li>
                    <li>This means that the polyps, which are the basic living unit of corals, are highly associated to
                        one another.
                    </li>
                    <li>Their tissues are more closely connected than those of other corals and are not separated by
                        skeletal structures.
                    </li>
                    <li>Many researchers think that the more integrated a coral’s polyp tissue is, the more advanced the
                        coral species.
                    </li>
                    <li>Tissue integration is advantageous because the coral polyps are able to transfer molecules such
                        as nutrients, hormones, and oxygen—making it easier for the brain coral colony to communicate.
                    </li>
                    <li>They can grow six feet tall and live for up to 900 years!</li>

                    <li>Statement 2: This bill needs to be passed in both houses. However, Lok Sabha exercises more
                        powers in money matters. Once the Lok Sabha passes the budget of the government or any other
                        money related law, the Rajya Sabha cannot reject it. The Rajya Sabha can only delay it by 14
                        days or suggest changes in it. The Lok Sabha may or may not accept these changes.

                        which members of both the Houses sit together. Because of the larger number of members, the view
                        of the Lok Sabha is likely to prevail in such a meeting.

                <p>Project Dantak was raised in May 1961 in Eastern Bhutan. A humble beginning was made in bamboo huts
                    and thatched roofs. Since then Project Dantak has not looked back. It has contributed to economic
                    growth of Bhutan by not only developing roads and tele-communication net works but also other
                    prestigious works throughout Bhutan. Over the years, Project Dantak has constructed 1500 Km of
                    roads, airfields, a number of helipads, tele-communication network in Bhutan, Indo-Bhutan Microwave
                    link, Bhutan Broadcasting Station, the prestigious India House Complex, Chukha Hydel Housing
                    Complex, Hydel Sub-stations, river training works, Schools and Colleges.</p></div>

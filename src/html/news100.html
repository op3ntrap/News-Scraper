            <ul>
                <li>Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has asked the State governments to push up implementation of “<strong>impactful”
                    projects</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>“<strong>Impactful” projects:</strong></li>
                <li>The Centre and the State governments together have identified <strong>261 projects </strong>worth
                    ₹<strong>32,600 crore</strong> under this category.
                </li>
                <li>Majority of these projects are in the first lot of 20 smart cities announced in January 2016.</li>
                <li><strong>Drawback:</strong> Projects have been shortlisted without any clear definition of what
                    “impactful” means. These projects are expected to have visible and transformative impact on the
                    various aspects of the lives of the citizens.
                </li>
                <li>The list of “impactful” projects varies from Museum of Urban History in Bhubaneswar, to Adventure
                    Park in Udaipur, to rejuvenation of water bodies in Coimbatore, to 5 km-long heritage walk in
                    Warangal, to conservation of built heritage in Thanjavur, to redevelopment of world-famous
                    Manikarnika Ghat in Varanasi.

                <li><strong>Reality of Smart City projects:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Prime Minister has directed the Chief Secretaries to review the progress of projects on

                        </li>
                        <li>Since the list of first 20 smart cities came out on January 1, 2016, questions have been
                            raised on the mission.
                        </li>
                        <li>For one, the Smart City is a misnomer, because only small pockets of the city are to be
                            developed.
                        </li>
                        <li>The latest review of Smart City projects reveals that only <strong>79 projects</strong> with
                            total budget of ₹ <strong>8</strong><strong>41 crore</strong> have been completed. Another
                            <strong>204 projects</strong>, with a budget of ₹ 7963 crore are under implementation.

                essential to address India’s unemployment and under-employment issue,”</p>

                <p><span>DRDA has traditionally been the principal organ at the district level to oversee the implementation of anti-poverty programmes of the Ministry of Rural Development. This agency was created originally to implement the Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP). Subsequently the DRDAs were entrusted with number of programmes of both state and central governments. From April 1999 , a separate DRDA Administration has been introduced to take care of the administrative costs. This aims at strengthening the DRDAs and makes them more professional in managing the anti-poverty programmes and be an effective link between the ministry and the district level.</span>

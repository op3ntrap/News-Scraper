                                who must be able to swallow them — the pellets can be added to a spoonful of breast milk
                                or put on the infant’s tongue.

                                    <p>Kindly note that sandalwood is found in tropical decidous forests or monsoon
                                        forests which are found in western ghats, deccan plateu, northern plains and
                                        foot hills of Himalayas. Thus, sandalwood grows naturally in Himalaya
                                        foothills.</p></div>

                                    <p>Satipati Sampradaya, a tribal community in South Gujarat which resists
                                        associating itself with the administration, has been enrolled for the first time
                                        in the voters’ list and is likely to exercise franchise in the 2012 state
                                        assembly polls, officials said. The Sampradaya members have been enrolled in
                                        districts like Tapi, Dang, Narmada, Valsad, amongst others, and few have also
                                        been issued Electoral Photo Identity Cards enhancing probability of their
                                        participation in the elections. The tribal community takes pride in keeping
                                        themselves aloof from any of the government’s schemes. Dang, where around 90 per
                                        cent population is tribal, is considered to be base of Satipatis, with an
                                        estimated population of around 3,000 people.</p></div>

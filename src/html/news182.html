            <ul>
                <li>The Union government has set up a ministerial committee to frame a new law that would attract penal
                    provisions in the case of use <strong>of triple talaq or talaq-e-biddat</strong> for divorce between
                    Muslim couples, and will be bringing the new Bill in the winter session of Parliament.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Talaq-e-biddat:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Supreme Court had, in August this year, in a majority judgement set aside the practice of
                    talaq-e-biddat, an arbitrary and unilateral decision by a Muslim husband to end the marriage by
                    utterance of the word talaq three times.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key Point</strong>: As the law stands today, the victims have no option even after approaching
                the police as there exists no provision in law to take action against the husband.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The International Court of Justice is the primary judicial branch of the United Nations
                            (UN). Seated in the Peace Palace in The Hague, Netherlands, the court settles legal disputes
                            submitted to it by states and provides advisory opinions on legal questions submitted to it
                            by duly authorized international branches, agencies, and the UN General Assembly.
                        </li>
                        <li>The ICJ is composed of fifteen judges elected to nine-year terms by the UN General Assembly
                            and the UN Security Council from a list of people nominated by the national groups in the
                            Permanent Court of Arbitration.
                        </li>
                        <li>The election process is set out in Articles 4–19 of the ICJ statute. Elections are
                            staggered, with five judges elected every three years to ensure continuity within the court.
                            Should a judge die in office, the practice has generally been to elect a judge in a special
                            election to complete the term.

            <ul>
                <li>Amnesty International said that Myanmar’s persecution of Rohingya Muslims fits the legal definition
                    of apartheid, a crime against humanity.
                </li>
                <li>In a report based on a two-year investigation, the group said that Rohingya, a mostly stateless
                    minority from Myanmar’s western state of Rakhine, are “trapped in a vicious system of
                    state-sponsored, institutionalized discrimination.”
                </li>
                <li>Amnesty traces the roots of the crisis to systemic discrimination and segregation that has
                    intensified dramatically since 2012, when deadly riots erupted between Buddhists and Muslims in
                    several parts of the state. Buddhists make up the majority in both Rakhine state and in the country
                    at large.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Key Fact:</strong> The Rohingya are widely considered one of the world’s most persecuted
                    minorities.

                        between 1948 and 1991.Broadly speaking, apartheid was delineated into petty apartheid, which
                        entailed the segregation of public facilities and social events, and grand apartheid, which

            <ul>
                <li>China has proposed a three-phase plan for resolving the Rohingya crisis, starting with a ceasefire
                    in Myanmar’s Rakhine State so that refugees can return from Bangladesh, China’s Foreign Ministry
                    said ahead of meeting of European and Asian officials in Myanmar.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Rohingya crisis</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The refugee crisis erupted after the military launched a brutal counter-insurgency operations
                    against the militants after attacks on an army base and dozens of police security posts in Rakhine
                    on Aug. 25.
                </li>
                <li>Consequently, more than 600,000 Muslim Rohingya fled to Bangladesh .</li>
                <li>Myanmar’s military has said that all fighting against the Rohingya Islamist militants died out on
                    Sept.5, but it remains on guard against incursions by fighters who had fled to Bangladesh with the
                    refugees.
                </li>
                <li>The group behind those attacks, Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), had declared a one-month
                    ceasefire on Sept.10, which was rejected by the government. But there have been no serious clashes
                    since.
                </li>
                <li>The refugees’ suffering has caused an international outcry.</li>

                    multilateral diplomatic gathering which happens once every two years and is designed to discuss
                    issues between Asia and Europe.

            <p><strong>China’s 3 stage solution :</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The first stage is to effect a ceasefire on the ground, to return to stability and order, so the
                    people can enjoy peace and no longer be forced to flee.
                </li>
                <li>According to Chinese official the first phase’s aim has already basically been achieved, and the key
                    is to prevent a flare-up.
                </li>
                <li>Second stage is bilateral dialogue to find a workable solution.</li>
                <li>The third phase should be to work toward a long-term solution based on poverty alleviation as
                    poverty was the root cause of the conflict.
                </li>

            <p><strong>Myanmar’s Increased Engagement with the World</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The United States and other Western countries have become more engaged with Myanmar since it began a
                    transition to civilian government after nearly 50 years of military rule.
                </li>
                <li>China has close relations with both Myanmar and Bangladesh, and has long been a key player in
                    lawless borderlands where rebel ethnic groups have fought Myanmar’s government for decades.
                </li>
                <li>The conflict in those border regions have occasionally pushed thousands of refugees to seek shelter
                    in China.
                </li>
                <li>Since the Rohingya crisis, China has repeatedly expressed support for what it calls the Myanmar
                    government’s efforts to protect stability.
                </li>
                <li>The international community and the United Nations Security Council are expected to give
                    encouragement and support to Myanmar and Bangladesh to create the necessary conditions and a good
                    environment.

                <li>The draft also sets out penalties of ₹1 crore and above and jail terms for violations.</li>
                <li>The proposed bill, also seeks to keep the government out of any liability arising out of harm that
                    these commercial activities may cause — to people, environment, other countries or outer space.
                </li>
                <li>The draft Bill defines objects, people and geography that will come under the future law.</li>

            <p><strong>New body proposed</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>All persons or entities engaged in space will now need a licence</li>
                <li>The government will form a new authorised body for the purpose of issuing license.</li>
                <li>So far, the national space agency Indian Space Research Organisation’s major works have related to
                    satellites, launchers and applications. These were governed by the Satellite Communication Policy,
                    2000; the Remote Sensing Data Policy, 2011; and international treaty obligations on outer space
                    activities as mandated by the <strong>UN Committee on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space or
                        UNCOPUOS.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why such a law is needed?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increasing applications of Space-based solutions have meant an increased participation of private
                    sector industry and startups.
                </li>
                <li>Commercial opportunities in space activities and services, nationally and internationally, demand a
                    higher order of participation by private sector agencies. This situation demands a necessary legal
                    environment for orderly performance and growth of space sector.

                <li>Astronomers have discovered some of the oldest stars in our Milky Way galaxy by determining their
                    locations and velocities.
                </li>
                <li>Just like humans, stars have a life span: birth, youth, adulthood, senior and death.</li>
                <li>Scientists at Georgia State University in the U.S. focussed on old or “senior citizen” stars, also
                    known as <strong>cool subdwarfs</strong>, that are much older and cooler in temperature than the
                    Sun.
                </li>
                <li>In a study, astronomers conducted a census of our solar neighbourhood to identify how many young,
                    adult and old stars are present.
                </li>
                <li>They targeted stars out to a distance of 200 light years, which is relatively nearby considering the
                    galaxy is more than 1,00,000 light years across.
                </li>
                <li>A light year is how far light can travel in one year.</li>

            <li>A kanger is an earthen pot woven around with wicker filled with hot embers used by Kashmiris and
                Himachalis beneath their traditional clothing to keep the chill at bay, which is also regarded as a work
                of art. In Kashmir, it is normally kept inside the Phiran, the Kashmiri cloak, or inside a blanket. If a
                person is wearing a jacket, it may be used as a hand warmer.
            </li>
            <li>It is generally believed that Kashmiris learnt the use of the kangri from the Italians who were in the
                retinue of the Mughal emperors, and usually visited the Valley during summer. In Italy (where a similar
                device was known as a scaldino) and Spain, braziers were made in a great variety of shapes and were
                profusely ornamented. Historical data, however, contradicts the claim that kangri came to Kashmir from
                Italy, but it is known that it was used in the time of the Mughal Empire. Those visiting Kashmir for the
                first time during the winter season are surprised to find people carrying firepots in their hands or in
                their laps but every Kashmiri know how to handle the apparatus with care. It is a part of Kashmiri
                tradition and even in modern times it sees a huge demand, and is even used in public or private offices
                during winters.

                <strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
            <p>In order to protect the rich aquatic biodiversity of river Ganga from escalating anthropogenic pressures,
                development of a Turtle sanctuary in Allahabad along with a River Biodiversity Park at Sangam have been
                approved under Namami Gange programme.</p>
            <p><u>Key facts</u>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The project at an estimated cost of Rs 1.34 crore would include development of River Biodiversity
                    Park at Sangam (confluence of Ganga, Yamuna and mythical Sarasvati), establishment of a Turtle
                    Rearing Centre (Permanent nursery at Triveni Pushp and makeshift annual hatcheries) and awareness
                    about the importance of river Ganga and imperativeness of its conservation has been approved.
                </li>
                <li>This project will provide much needed platform to make the visitors aware of their place in the
                    ecosystem, their roles and responsibilities, improve their understanding of the complexity of
                    co-existence with the environment and help generate awareness for reducing the impact of human
                    activities on critical natural resources.
                </li>
                <li>The task of dissipating knowledge about river Ganga will be taken up ardently in this project, which
                    is 100% centrally funded.

            <li>
                <p>You are a Public Information Officer (PIO) in a government department. You are aware that the RTI Act
                    2005 envisages transparency and accountability in administration. The act has functioned as a check
                    on the supposedly arbitrarily administrative behaviour and actions. However, as a PIO you have
                    observed that there are citizens who filed RTI applications not for themselves but on behalf of such
                    stakeholders who purportedly want to have access to information to further their own interests. At
                    the same time there are these RTI activists who routinely file RTI applications and attempt to
                    extort money from the decision makers. This type of RTI activism has affected the functioning of the
                    administration adversely and also possibly jeopardises the genuineness of the applications which are
                    essentially aimed at getting justice.</p>
                <p>What measures would you suggest to separate genuine and non-genuine applications? Give merits and
                    demerits of your suggestions. (Mains- 2017)</p>

            <p><strong>In news:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Supreme Court decided to constitute a <strong>five-judge Constitution Bench</strong> to hear
                    petitions from November against the <strong>validity of the Aadhaar scheme</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>The decision to set up a five-judge Bench comes despite Justice Rohinton Nariman’s separate judgment
                    in the nine-judge Bench declaring <strong>privacy as a fundamental right.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Historic judgment</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The nine-judge Bench of the Supreme Court came out with the historic judgment in favour of the
                    common man’s fundamental right to privacy against state intrusions.
                </li>
                <li>The nine-judge Bench verdict has a crucial bearing in the Aadhaar petitions, which have argued that
                    Aadhaar’s use of biometric details like fingerprints and iris scans violate bodily and informational
                    privacy.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Petitioner’s contentions: </strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The petitioners argue that mandatory requirement of Aadhaar for these schemes “constrict rights and
                    freedoms which a citizen has long been enjoying unless and until they part with their personal
                    biometric information to the government”.
                </li>
                <li>The petitions have termed the <strong>Aadhaar Act of 2016</strong> as
                    <strong>unconstitutional</strong> and contrary to concept of limited and accountable
                    governance.<strong> </strong></li>

            <ul>
                <li>Law Commission of India in it’s 273rd Report recommended the implementation of ‘<strong>United
                    Nations Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or
                    Punishment</strong>’ through Legislation.
                </li>
                <li>The Commission also submitted a draft <strong>Prevention of Torture Bill</strong> for the
                    consideration of the Government.
                </li>
                <li>The Commission submitted that there has to be some effective mechanism to protect the interests of
                    the victims of torture, the complainants and the witnesses against ill-treatment, threats or
                    physical and mental violence.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Highlight:</strong> “Torture has been a contentious issue having a direct bearing on the
                    <strong>right to life and liberty of an individual</strong>. The Commission is of the opinion that
                    such heinous acts must be curbed through strong legislation providing stringent punishment, will act
                    as a deterrent”.
                </li>
                <li>Based on the analysis of various aspects of torture, the Commission has prepared a draft Bill titled
                    “<strong>The Prevention of Torture Bill, 2017″</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>The Commission made the following recommendations to the Government;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While deciding on as to what amounts to torture by a public servant, the</p>
            <p>Commission has suggested <strong>definition of ‘torture’</strong> wide enough to include inflicting
                injury, either intentionally or involuntarily, or even an attempt to cause such an injury, which will
                include physical, mental or psychological injury.</p>
            <p>(i) <strong>Ratification of Convention against Torture</strong></p>
            <p>In order to tide over the difficulties faced by the Country in getting criminals</p>
            <p>extradited, in the absence of an anti-torture law; and to secure an individual’s right to life and
                liberty, the Commission recommends consideration of the Convention Against Torture for ratification and
                in the event, the Central Government decides to ratify the Convention, then the Prevention Of Torture
                Bill 2017 may be considered.</p>
            <p>(ii) <strong>Amendment to Existing Statutes</strong></p>
            <p>The commission has come to the conclusion that the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 and the Indian Evidence
                Act, 1872 require amendments to accommodate provisions regarding compensation and burden of proof,
                respectively.</p>
            <p><strong>Criminal Procedure Code, 1973</strong></p>
            <p>The Commission recommends amendment to section 357B to incorporate payment of compensation, in addition
                to payment or fine, as provided under section 326A or section 376D of the Indian Penal Code,1860.</p>
            <p><strong>Indian Evidence Act, 1872</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Requires insertion of section 114B :</strong> this will ensure that in case a person in police
                custody sustains injuries, it is presumed that those injuries have been inflicted by the police, and the
                burden of proof shall lie on the authority concerned to explain such injury.</p>
            <p>(iii<strong>). Punishment for acts of torture:</strong> In order to curb the menace of torture and to
                have a deterrent effects on acts of torture , the Commission recommends stringent punishment to the
                perpetrators of such acts. The draft Bills provides for punishment extending up to life imprisonment and
                fine.</p>
            <p><strong>(iv) Compensation to victims</strong></p>
            <p>The Courts will decide upon a justiciable compensation after taking into</p>
            <p>account various facets of an individual case, such as nature, purpose, extent and manner of injury,
                including mental agony caused to the victim. The Courts will bear in mind the socio-economic background
                of the victim and will ensure that the compensation so decided will suffice the victim to bear the
                expenses on medical treatment and rehabilitation.</p>
            <p><strong>(v) Protection of Victims, Complainants and witnesses</strong></p>
            <p>The Commission recommends that an effective mechanism must be put in place in order to protect the
                victims of torture, the complainants and the witnesses against possible threats, violence or ill
                treatment.</p>

                came into being after the birth of scripts in ancient civilization<strong>. </strong>When a large amount
                of administrative data was created, a system was needed to retrieve the stored
                knowledge<strong>. </strong>And this gave rise to archiving, cataloguing and classifying. More than
                writing, it was this method of retrieval that led to efficiency</p>
            <p><strong>People’s connection with bureaucracy: </strong>Bureaucracy is new in developing countries.</p>
            <p>And we must realise that institutionally, people are not “bureaucracy-receptive”</p>
            <p><strong>Bureaucracy and India:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Indian villager accesses the state through a local leader.Everyone knows everyone else and
                    independent bureaucracy cannot be executed in the web of interdependent informal relationships among
                    the stakeholders
                </li>
                <li>When the state creates a new bureaucratic framework that trumps local networks (on which informal
                    societies such as India are built), citizens become confused and find themselves at a loss to
                    negotiate their space
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Customs and norms in India:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Societies carry a historical burden of norms and customs</li>
                <li>Mostly informal in nature, these institutions cannot be changed overnight</li>
                <li>New laws and regulations introduced in any society must recognise the informal social norms society
                    is predicated upon
                </li>
                <li>In societies such as India, citizen-state interaction is historically built on patronage and
                    personal relations; bureaucratic forms of engagement are recent
                </li>
                <li>Western societies that are individualised, are prepared to function bureaucratically, and can
                    successfully build independent regulatory bodies
                </li>
                <li>But collectivist societies like India cannot, and may be should not, try this</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The way forward</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>In diverse societies, bureaucracies have to be contextual, and therefore emotional</li>
                <li>They must be designed for everyone, and not just for the urban elites</li>
                <li>Regulations force people to change their behaviour and dynamics instantly</li>
                <li>If the bureaucracy is not empathetic to those who are slow in responding, it will be hugely damaging
                    to society as a whole
                </li>
                <li>It will leave so many of us distressed, some of us dead, and even worse, most of us devoid of
                    compassion
                </li>

                <li><strong>Citing a lack of “consensus,”</strong> China has said that it is once again not designating
                    Masood Azhar, head of Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad, as an international terrorist.
                </li>
                <li>The Chinese position, expressed by its Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying, came ahead of
                    Thursday’s meeting of the 1267 <strong>committee of the United Nations Security Council</strong>,
                    where Azhar’s status would be discussed.

                    been accused of masterminding last year’s attack on an Indian Air Force base.
                </li>
                <li>In January, the United States filed a fresh application, backed by Britain and France after India’s

            <ul>
                <li>Death from tuberculosis in India saw a 12% decline from last year.</li>
                <li>The number of new cases saw a 5% increase.</li>
                <li>With 1.7 million new cases in 2016, <strong>India continued to be the largest contributor to the
                    global burden with up to a quarter of the 6.3 million new cases of TB</strong> (up from 6.1 million
                    in 2015).
                </li>
                <li>In spite of this year’s dip, India accounts for about 32% of the number of people worldwide who
                    succumbed to the disease.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Key fact:</strong></li>
                <li>Rise in cases was due to greater surveillance and the dip in mortality from 480,000 to 423,000 in
                    2016, due to improved drug management.
                </li>
                <li>Globally, the TB mortality rate is falling at about 3% per year.</li>
                <li>TB incidence is falling at about 2% per year and 16% of TB cases die from the disease.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key Inference:</strong> “Overall, the latest picture is one of a still high burden of disease,
                and progress that is not fast enough to reach targets or to make major headway in closing persistent
                gaps,”.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>“The Lancet Countdown: Tracking Progress on Health and Climate Change” published by The
                    Lancet: </strong></li>
                <li>The Lancet report talks of the various ways climate change has started affecting the health of
                    people across the planet.
                </li>
                <li>On an average there has been a 5.3% fall in productivity for rural labour estimated globally since
                    2000, as a result of rising temperatures around the world.
                </li>
                <li>In 2016, this took more than 9,20,000 people globally out of the workforce, with 4,18,000 of them in
                    India alone.
                </li>
                <li>China, Bangladesh, India and Indonesia are the countries that have registered the highest number of
                    deaths linked to air pollution.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Anthropogenic effect</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The research builds on the work of the 2015 Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change, which
                    concluded that anthropogenic climate change threatens to undermine the last 50 years of gains in
                    public health.
                </li>
                <li>The report said that over one billion people globally will be faced with a need to migrate within 90
                    years, due to a rise in sea level caused by ice shelf collapse, unless action is taken.
                </li>
                <li>The research found that 87% of a random sample of global cities are in breach of WHO air pollution
                    guidelines.
                </li>
                <li>The world has seen a 46% global increase in weather related disasters since 2000, the reported
                    pointed out. The total value of economic losses resulting from climate-related extreme weather
                    events was estimated at $129 billion in 2016.<strong> </strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key Findings:  “</strong>The findings show that climate change is affecting the health of all
                populations, today. These impacts are disproportionately felt by communities least responsible for
                climate change and those who are the most vulnerable in society.”</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Between financial year 2012- 13 and 2015-16, the five national parties received a total of
                        Rs.1,070.68 crore via voluntary contributions above Rs.20,000.
                    </li>
                    <li>Of this, 89%, or Rs.77 crore, was from corporate and business houses, according to the
                        Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR).
                    </li>
                    <li>The BJP received the lion’s share of the corporate donations, lapping up Rs.81 crore from 2,987
                        corporate donors. This is nearly three times the combined corporate donations received by the
                        remaining four parties.
                    </li>
                    <li>The BJP received the highest donations from all the 14 sectors, as defined by the ADR, including
                        real estate (Rs.20 crore); mining, construction, exports/imports (Rs.83.56 crore); and
                        chemicals/pharmaceuticals (Rs.31.94 crore).

                    <li>In 1,933 donations involving Rs.04 crore, PAN details were not mentioned. Address details were

                <ul>
                    <li>Every year, political parties are required to submit details of donations above Rs.20,000 to the

                    </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Government of India plans to deport about 40,000 Rohingya immigrants from Myanmar.</li>
                    <li>As a reaction, international human rights agencies Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch
                        called upon India to “abide by international legal obligations” and not force them to return,
                        which they termed an “outrageous” move.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong><u>Context/Background:</u></strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The international organisations opine, while India is not a party to the 1951 Refugee Convention
                        or its 1967 Protocol, it is still bound by customary international law not to forcibly return
                        any refugee to a place where they face a serious risk of persecution or threats to their life or
                        freedom.
                    </li>
                    <li>The basis of this argument is the international principle of “non-refoulement” adopted by the
                        UN.
                    </li>
                    <li>Indian Home Ministry issued a statement on identifying and deporting Rohingyas, including about
                        16,500 who have been registered by the UN High Commission for Refugees in India.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Rohingyas who fled to India after violence in the Western Rakhine State were mainly settled
                        in Jammu, Hyderabad, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi-NCR and Rajasthan.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Home ministry has issued an advisory to the State governments to deport all foreign
                        nationals who are staying illegally in India, citing security threats posed by them.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong><u>What is Principle of Non-refoulement?</u></strong></p>
                <p>It is a fundamental principle of international law which forbids a country receiving asylum
                    seekers from returning them to a country in which they would be in likely danger of persecution
                    based on “race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political
                    opinion”</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>A brief analysis of the outcomes of the recent visits of Prime Minister and the changing
                        dimensions of India’s foreign policy
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Indo-US:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The visit focused mainly on counter-terrorism and security co-operation and avoided the
                        contentious trade related issues.
                    </li>
                    <li>The success in these two areas can be noticed by:</li>
                    <li>The naming of the Hizbul Mujahedeen chief as a “specially designated global terrorist” and a
                        “new consultation mechanism on domestic and international terrorist designations listing
                        proposals”
                    </li>
                    <li>Confirmation of the sale of the Guardian Unmanned Aerial System to India.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Indo-Israel:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>First ever first to Israel by an Indian PM</li>
                    <li>Elevation of the India-Israel relationship to the level of a ‘strategic partnership’.</li>
                    <li>The main focus of the visit was on defence cooperation, joint development of defence products
                        and transfer of technology.
                    </li>
                    <li>Most of the agreements signed related to transfer of technology and innovative
                        technology-related items and India expects to benefit substantially, considering that Israeli
                        export rules are far more flexible than those of the U.S.
                    </li>
                    <li><u>Some sticky points in Indo_Israel:</u></li>
                    <li>India and Israel decided to set up a $40 million Innovation Fund to allow Indian and Israeli
                        enterprises to develop innovative technologies and products for commercial applications.
                    </li>
                    <li>However, Israel-China comprehensive innovation partnership which has an outlay of $300 million
                        clearly overshadows this.
                    </li>
                    <li>India and Israel also have differences over China’s BRI:(Belt and Road initiative) Israel is
                        eager to participate in it, unlike India, and possibly views this as an opportunity to develop a
                        project parallel to the Suez Canal.
                    </li>
                    <li>Both countries also expressed a strong commitment to combat terror. The reality, however, is
                        that when the two countries speak of terrorism, they speak of very different things.
                    </li>
                    <li>Iran and Hezbollah are the main targets for Israel, which has little interest in the Afghan
                        Taliban or Pakistan’s Lashkar-e-Taiba. For India, it is the latter that matters.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Indo-China-Pak:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>China is increasingly and aggressively expanding its political and economic presence in the East
                        and Southeast Asia, South Asia and now slowly increasing its presence into West Asia.
                    </li>
                    <li>For instance, China’s influence in Iran is very high vis-a-vis that of India.</li>
                    <li>Experts opine that, India, however has put up a courageous fight against China. It has not been
                        ruffled either by BRI or Doklam standoff.
                    </li>
                    <li>Few other countries in Asia are, however willing to cooperate with China.</li>
                    <li>A divided house in ASEAN with most countries in the region wanting to join China-based
                        initiatives. Even in South Asia, despite India’s commanding presence, China has been successful
                        in winning quite a few friends among India’s neighbours such as Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and
                        the Maldives.
                    </li>
                    <li>Pakistan continues to be a rogue state and its unrelenting stand to tackle terrorism has led to
                        a virtual diplomatic standoff between India and Pakistan.
                    </li>
                    <li>As a consequence, India has been left with few options and this is leading to a <strong><em>diplomatic
                        gridlock</em></strong> which does not augur well for India.
                    </li>
                    <li>Pakistan’s dependence on China is growing due formers own internal stresses.</li>
                    <li>This is contributing to a strategic imbalance in the South Asian region, which is the main
                        context in which Indian diplomacy needs to redraw its arc of influence.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The Russia factor:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Russia is undergoing a strategic resurgence, sustained in good measure by the close relations
                        recently established with China. Buoyed by developments in the Ukraine and Crimea, and the
                        uncertainties surrounding U.S. commitment to NATO, the new Russia-China ‘strategic congruence’
                        is certain to impact Asia.
                    </li>
                    <li>At this juncture, India-Russia relations appear less robust than at any time in the past half
                        century. India’s ‘Act East and Look West’ policies have given a new dimension to Indian
                        diplomacy in both East and West Asia. However, diminishing diplomatic influence in the West
                        Asian region vis-a-vis increasing influence of Russia and China is a cause of concern.
                    </li>
                    <li>The ‘Act East’ policy has produced better results. Closer relations with countries in East and
                        South East Asia, especially Japan and Vietnam, are a positive development. However, in the
                        Asia-Pacific, India has to contend with an increasingly assertive China. There is little
                        evidence to show that India’s diplomatic manoeuvres individually, or with allies like Japan,
                        have succeeded in keeping the Chinese juggernaut at bay — or for that matter provide an
                        alternative to China in the Asia-Pacific.
                    </li>
                    <li>Indian diplomacy, therefore, needs a renewed strategy and also display still higher levels of
                        sophistication to overcome the odds.
                    </li>

                        <p>Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a disease spread through mosquito bites. Symptoms usually take

                            <p>In significant changes in electoral funding norms, corporate donations to political
                                parties will no longer face any ceiling linked to firms’ profitability and companies
                                will no longer be obliged to inform their shareholders which party’s coffers they
                                contribute to. These changes were introduced by the government in the amendments to the
                                Finance act of 2017 Earlier, companies can only contribute up to 7.5% of their average
                                net profits in the past three financial years to political parties. Moreover, they are
                                required to disclose the amount of contributions made and the names of the political
                                parties to which they were made, in their profit and loss accounts. The government has
                                included an amendment to the Companies Act of 2013 to do away with the 7.5% of net
                                profits limit set on donations and the requirement for a company to disclose the name of
                                political parties to which they donate. </p></div>

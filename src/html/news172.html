                    <li>As technology develops, so does the scope to misuse it.</li>
                    <li>The police observed it with Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) facility, which is increasingly
                        used for criminal activities.
                    </li>
                    <li>Flashers, devices that can change IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) numbers of
                        handsets, are used to make stolen cell phones untraceable, and SIM boxes enable setting up of
                        illegal telephone exchanges that rake in crores of rupees and cause massive losses to the
                        government.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p> </p>
                <p><strong>No international tariff</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>“Each SIM box can hold up to 32 SIM cards which route international calls. A person in Dubai can
                        call a local number from Dubai, which will be routed to a number in India and then to the
                        intended call recipient. This way, the caller avoids the international tariff, which causes loss
                        of revenue to the government. Even if operators of SIM box rackets charge 60% of the tariff,
                        they make crores in a month,” said a Crime Branch officer who is part of the probe.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p> </p>
                <p><strong>Hawala money</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Investigations conducted so far into the two illegal exchanges that were running in Mumbai have
                        indicated that the accused got money from their Dubai counterparts via hawala channels.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Dubai-based operators, who were allegedly the masterminds, would take a percentage of the
                        profits, keep some aside for maintenance of equipment and send the rest to their Indian
                        counterparts.
                    </li>
                    <li>The entire racket was operating on word of mouth. The Dubai-based operators had spread the word
                        that they had the resources in case anyone wanted to make calls abroad at concessional rates.
                    </li>
                    <li>The preliminary estimate of the losses caused to the national exchequer is around ₹100 crore.

                        unprecedented order passed by the second senior-most judge, Justice J. Chelameshwar, to
                        constitute a five-judge bench to deal with bribery allegations against a retired high court

                        judge Justice I.M. Quiddusi had taken a bribe with the promise of influencing a Supreme Court

                    <li>The matter concerns two petitions seeking a probe by a special investigation team (SIT) into
                        allegations of corruption contained in a first information report registered by the CBI last
                        September.
                    </li>
                    <li>The FIR alleged that a conspiracy was hatched by some persons, including a former Orissa High
                        Court judge and a hawala dealer, to bribe Supreme Court judges hearing the case of a debarred
                        private medical college.
                    </li>

                        National Green Tribunal (NGT) ordered, the Capital’s public transport infrastructure would need
                        a significant refurbishment.

                <ul>
                    <li>Public transport needs to be streamlined. We need to have evaluated pathways only for buses.
                        Merely increasing the number of buses is not a solution.
                    </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>The Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA) forms the core of the legal framework
                                put in place by India to combat money laundering. It came into force in 2005.</p>
                            <p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>The PMLA seeks to combat money laundering in India and has three main objectives:
                                </li>
                                <li>To prevent and control money laundering</li>
                                <li>To confiscate and seize the property obtained from the laundered money; and</li>
                                <li>To deal with any other issue connected with money laundering in India</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>PMLA defines money laundering offence and provides for the freezing, seizure and
                                confiscation of the proceeds of crime.</p>
                            <p><strong>Salient Features</strong> :</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong> </strong>RBI, SEBI and IRDA have been brought under the PMLA, and therefore
                                    the provisions of this act are applicable to all financial institutions, banks,
                                    mutual funds, insurance companies, and their financial intermediaries.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>The agency monitoring the anti-Money laundering activities in India is the
                                    Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU-IND). This unit is responsible for receiving,
                                    processing, analysing and disseminating information relating to suspect financial

                                    crimes. </strong></li>
                                <li>FIU-IND is an independent body reporting directly to the Economic Intelligence

                                <li>Punishment for offence of money laundering: There can be punishment of imprisonment
                                    upto 3-7 years with fine upto 5 lakh rupees. But in case of offences done under

                                    10 years rather than 7 years.

                    <p>Gasification is a process that converts organic or fossil fuel based carbonaceous materials into
                        carbon monoxide, hydrogen and carbon dioxide. This is achieved by reacting the material at high
                        temperatures (&gt;700 °C), without combustion, with a controlled amount of oxygen and/or steam.
                        The resulting gas mixture is called syngas (from synthesis gas) or producer gas and is itself a
                        fuel.</p></div>

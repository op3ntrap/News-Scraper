                <ul>
                    <li>Sabarimala temple and restricted entry of women of a certain age.</li>
                    <li>The temple prohibits women aged between 10 and 50 from undertaking pilgrimage to Sabarimala —
                        which means women are banned from even making the arduous trek to the shrine.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>In news:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>From three judge bench to constitution bench:</strong> The Supreme Court will pronounce
                        verdict on whether to refer to a Constitution Bench a bunch of petitions challenging the age-old
                        practice in Kerala’s famed Sabarimala temple to restrict entry of women of a certain age.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Prime issues to be dealt by the constitution bench:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Whether the multitude of worshippers of Swami Ayyappa visiting the famous shrine located
                                in Kerala form a separate religious “denomination.”
                            </li>
                            <li>If so, should their privilege to manage their religious affairs yield to the fundamental
                                right of women to practice religion freely.
                            </li>
                            <li>Included whether the restriction is a “permissible practice”</li>
                            <li>Who is the competent authority to decide on whether the restriction comes within the
                                ambit of ‘custom’; and, finally, whether such a ‘custom’ comes under the constitutional
                                principles.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Reasons for the restriction: </strong>The restriction finds its source in the
                                legend that the Sabarimala temple deity, Swami Ayyappa, is a ‘Naishtika Brahmachari’ and
                                should not be disturbed.

                    <li>Supports the restriction imposed on women devotees.</li>
                    <li>It had found that the restriction was in place since time immemorial and not discriminatory
                        under the Constitution.

                        <li>The reduction of embarkation points for Haj pilgrimage from the existing 21 to only nine
                            across the country.
                        </li>
                        <li>Abolishing subsidy for Haj pilgrims and allowing women above 45 years of age to travel in a
                            group of at least four without a male.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Reason: termination of flights from Jaipur. The Haj flights from the State capital had
                            started in 2005 after a seven-year-long agitation.
                        </li>
                        <li>The termination of flights from Jaipur would put the pilgrims to a great inconvenience, as
                            they would be required to travel to either Delhi or Ahmedabad to board the special flights.
                            It will impose an additional expenditure and cause a great difficulty to old and infirm
                            pilgrims.
                        </li>
                        <li>Allowing women to travel without a male companion was against the principles of Shariah</li>

                    <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The recent Supreme Court Ruling that criminalises sex with wife below 18 years of age</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>By ruling that marriage cannot be a licence to have sex with a minor girl, the Supreme Court
                            has corrected an anomaly in the country’s criminal law.
                        </li>
                        <li>Earlier, the age of consent under the IPC was raised in 2013 from 16 to 18 to bring it in
                            line with the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO), 2012. However, the
                            age above which marriage is an exception to rape was retained at 15, as fixed in 1940.
                        </li>
                        <li>Under the Indian Penal Code, it is an offence to have sex with a girl below 18 years of age,
                            regardless of consent.
                        </li>
                        <li>In other words, what was statutory rape is treated as permissible within a marriage.</li>
                        <li>By reading down the exception to limit it to girls aged 18 and older, the court has sought
                            to harmonise the various laws in which any person under 18 is a minor.
                        </li>
                        <li>Child marriage is a social evil and a serious infringement of child rights.</li>
                        <li>It adversely affects the physical and mental health of children, denies them opportunities
                            for education, infringes on their bodily autonomy and deprives them of any role in deciding
                            on many aspects of their lives.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong> Practical application:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is not clear yet whether all men married to girls between the ages of 15 and 18 to be
                            condemned to face criminal cases as rapists.
                        </li>
                        <li>Given the prevalence of child marriage in this country, it is doubtful whether it is
                            possible or even desirable to implement the statutory rape law uniformly in the context of
                            marriages.
                        </li>
                        <li>It is not clear what it means for those married under Muslim personal law, which permits
                            girls below 18 to be married.
                        </li>
                        <li>POCSO criminalises even consensual teenage sexual activity and the latest ruling has brought
                            this into the domain of marriage.
                        </li>
                        <li>A teenager could be prosecuted for a sexual offence under POCSO even if he was just a little
                            above 18.
                        </li>
                        <li>Significantly, if boys under 18 but over 16 are charged with penetrative sexual assault
                            under POCSO or rape under the IPC, which can be termed ‘heinous offences’, they could face
                            the prospect of being tried as adults, according to the juvenile law as it stands now.
                        </li>
                        <li>Treating all below 18 as children may be good for their care and protection, but whether 18
                            is the right age for consent in this day and age remains a moot question.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The state’s argument that given the widespread prevalence of child marriage it is not possible to
                        remove the exception may be flawed from a formal standpoint, but its concerns about the
                        implications of the verdict must not be underestimated.</p>

                                and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO)</strong>, accusing it of “<strong>continuing
                                anti-Israel bias</strong>”. The U.S. withdrawal will take effect on December 31, 2018

                                a non-member observer state in order to contribute U.S. views, perspectives and
                                expertise on some of the important issues undertaken by the organisation, including the
                                protection of world heritage, advocating for press freedoms, and promoting scientific

                            <li><strong>Back in History:</strong> The U.S. had earlier once withdrawn from the UNESCO,
                                in 1984, under President Ronald Regan who accused it of favoring the Soviet Union. Under
                                President George W. Bush, Washington rejoined the organisation in 2002.

                            <li>It will bridge a bitter gulf between the Western-backed mainstream Fatah party and

                            <li>According to the analysts, the deal is more likely to stick than earlier ones given
                                Hamas’s growing isolation and realisation of how hard Gaza was to govern, after its
                                economy damaged by border blockades and infrastructure shattered by wars with Israel

                            <li>Why?:This is because these dishes have undergone fermentation, soaking, and germination,

                            </li>
                            <li>The high content of phytates (anti-oxidants in cereals, legumes and oilseeds) in Indian
                                foods slows down the absorption of iron and zinc. This causes deficiencies even in
                                people whose diet may contain abundant quantities of these minerals.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Suggestions: </strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Research efforts should focus on <strong>bioavailability (absorption by the
                                        body) rather than biofortification,</strong> as food sources already supply
                                        enough iron and zinc.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The absorption efficiency of these minerals among most Indians eating
                                        phytate-rich foods was below 10%. It should rise to 25% and above. This does not
                                        mean that people should quit vegetarian food, but they should adjust diets to
                                        reduce phytates.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The problem of phytates could also be overcome by eating fruits like guava and
                                        amla, and meat, poultry or fish.
                                    </li>

                        <p><strong>Basics:</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Global Hunger Index:</strong> The GHI score is a multidimensional index composed of
                            four indicators</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Proportion of undernourished in the population,</li>

                            <li>Child wasting.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Scores and indication: </strong>On the severity scale, a GHI score of less than 10
                            means “low” prevalence of hunger while a score of more than 50 implies an “extremely
                            alarming” situation.</p>
                        <p><strong>Key Highlights of Global Hunger Index report:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>India ranks 100 among 119 countries. It has a scores 31.4 on the Global Hunger Index
                                (GHI). India is at the high end of the “serious” category.
                            </li>
                            <li>More than one-fifth of Indian children under five weigh too little for their height and
                                over a third are too short for their age
                            </li>
                            <li>Comparison with other nations: Although India ranks above Pakistan, it performs dismally
                                with other such as Nepal (72), Myanmar (77), Bangladesh (88), Sri Lanka (84) and China
                                (29).
                            </li>
                            <li>India is the world’s second largest food producer, yet it is also home to the second
                                highest population of under-nourished in the world.
                            </li>
                            <li>According to the GHI report, more than a fifth (21%) of children in India suffer from
                                wasting (low weight for height)—up from 20% in 2005-2006.
                            </li>
                            <li>India’s poor score is one of the main factors pushing South Asia to the category of the
                                worst performing region on the GHI scale this year.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Best performers amongst Developing nations:</strong> Chile, Cuba and Turkey have
                                a GHI score of less than 5 and ranked the best among developing nations.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Worst performers:</strong> Nations like Chad and Central African Republic fare
                                the worst with a score of 43.5 and 50.9, respectively.

                        <ul>
                            <li>Increased spending by the government and lowering of interest rates by the RBI.</li>
                            <li>Fiscal stimulus is the only logical way to pull the economy out of slowdown.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Current state of the economy:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Data from 107 companies from the organised sector (excluding IT &amp; financial
                                services) indicate that number of persons employed by them has decreased by 2% between
                                Mar-2016 and Mar-2017.
                            </li>
                            <li>The latest RBI Consumer Confidence Survey concludes that there is significant dip in the
                                consumer confidence and business sentiment in manufacturing.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>The slowdown periods:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The period 2003/04-2007/08 witnessed the most rapid sustained GDP growth in India at 8%
                                per annum, riding on the boom in the world economy.
                            </li>
                            <li>Then came the bust, as growth dropped to 3.9% in 2008-09.</li>
                            <li>Surprisingly, GDP growth rose to 5% per annum during 2009/10-2010/11. This recovery was
                                attributable to counter-cyclical macroeconomic policies among other things.
                            </li>
                            <li>But the resilience did not last long. Growth slowed to 4% per annum during
                                2011/12-2013/14, as fiscal imbalances mounted, inflation quickened, and the current
                                account deficit in the balance of payments widened.
                            </li>
                            <li>In 2015-16 and 2016-17 the GDP growth rate averaged 7.5% owing to one thing only- sharp
                                drop in world oil prices, from more than $110 per barrel to less than $50 per barrel.
                                This led to decrease in current account deficit and fall in inflation.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Reasons:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Demonetisation and introduction of GST have led to decrease in output in mainly
                                unorganised sectors. But these are not the real reasons for the current slowdown in the
                                economy.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Structural reasons:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Rural distress:</strong> GDP per capita in the agricultural sector has been less
                                than one-tenth GDP per capita in the non-agricultural sector for 25 years. Employment
                                creation is negligible. The outcome is rural distress.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Low share of manufacturing:</strong> The share of manufacturing in GDP and
                                employment is lower than it was 25 years ago. India’s share in industrial production and
                                manufactured exports in the world economy has declined steadily.
                            </li>
                            <li>Thus, GDP growth is supported largely by the services sector, while employment growth in
                                the economy has been sustained essentially by construction activities and the informal
                                services sector both of which have been hurt by demonetization.
                            </li>
                            <li>RBI’s reluctance to cut interest rates: Between 2013-14 and 2015-16, the RBI repo rate,
                                which sets interest rates in the economy, was reduced by a mere 1.25 percentage points
                                although inflation came down by almost 5 percentage points in terms of the consumer
                                price index. The opportunity to stimulate investment by dropping interest rates sharply
                                was missed out altogether
                            </li>
                            <li>Appreciation of rupee leading to erosion of export competitiveness: Between January 2014
                                and June 2017, the rupee appreciated by 10% in nominal terms and 15% in real terms.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Remedial measures:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Government should undertake fiscal stimulus by increasing spending and reviving demand.
                                The government need to break free from the 3.5% fiscal deficit target and increase it to
                                4.0%. It is to be noted that borrowing is bad for the economy only when it is used for
                                paying debts. But if it is used for creation of infrastructure and investment then it is
                                actually god for the economy.
                            </li>
                            <li>RBI should lower the interest rates by 2 percentage points: It has to be noted that the
                                inflation in economy was controlled not due to lowering of interest rates but because of
                                the fall in global crude oil prices.
                            </li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Fiscal Deficit: A Fiscal Deficit occurs when government’s total expenditures exceed its
                                total revenues (excluding borrowings).
                            </li>
                            <li>Fiscal Stimulus: Increasing government spending on infrastructure etc in order to lift
                                investor sentiment, increase money supply in the market and increase demand in the
                                economy.

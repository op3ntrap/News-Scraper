                <li>The West Bengal government is considering a proposal to introduce separate <strong>English medium

                </strong>Introducing separate English medium sections in <strong>government-run schools</strong> had
                    become all the more important as such schools were lagging behind private English medium schools.

        <div id="To clear the path ahead">
            <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>For the first time in Indian history <strong>talaq-e-bid’awas</strong> specifically debated and set
                    aside by the Supreme Court
                </li>
                <li>Latest ruling completely and unconditionally invalidates <strong>talaq-e-bid’</strong> and renders
                    it bad in law.
                </li>
                <li>The <strong>Koranic procedure</strong> of talaq is the only way by which a Muslim husband will be
                    able to divorce his wife from now on
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Talaq-e-bidat</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Talaq-e-bidat has allowed men to pronounce talaq thrice in one sitting, sometimes scrawled in a
                    written talaqnama, or even by phone or text message.
                </li>
                <li>Thereafter, even if the man himself perceives his decision to have been hasty in hindsight, the
                    divorce remains irrevocable
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The majority judgment</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Talaq-e-bid’a cannot be excluded from the definition of “talaq” mentioned in Section 2 of the Muslim
                    Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937.
                </li>
                <li>As the Shariat Act was a law made before the Constitution came in force, it would fall within the
                    expression “laws in force” in Article 13(3)(b), and would be hit by Article 13(1) if found to be
                    inconsistent with Part III of the Constitution, to the extent of the inconsistency.
                </li>
                <li>The two judges chose not to examine if the Narasu Appa Maliruling. This judgment had held that
                    personal laws cannot be tested against the provisions of Part III of the Constitution.
                </li>
                <li>Biggest achievement was harmonisation of constitutional equality with Koranic egalitarianism.</li>
                <li>This was done by endorsing the Koranic law of talaq mentioned in Shamim Ara and declaring
                    talaq-e-bid’a to be “manifestly arbitrary” and violative of Article 14
                </li>
                <li>Because it allows a Muslim man to break the marriage “capriciously and whimsically” without
                    attempting to save it through reconciliation.
                </li>
                <li>On these grounds, Section 2 of the 1937 Act was struck down as being void to the extent that it
                    recognises and enforces instant talaq.
                </li>
                <li>Talaq-e-bid’a falls outside the Shariahbecause it goes against its primary source, the Koran</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The minority opinion</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Declared talaq-e-bid’a to be an essential part of the Hanafi faith and gave it protection under
                    Article 25(1).
                </li>
                <li>Given weight to the overwhelming evidence in the Koran and authentic hadeeses against instant talaq
                    they could have avoided the problematic invocation of Article 142 to direct the state to enact an
                    “appropriate legislation” on talaq-e-bid’a.
                </li>
                <li>Article 13(2) clearly states that the “State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the
                    rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall, to the extent
                    of the contravention, be void.
                </li>
                <li>The AIMPLB cited just one report from Sihah Sitta in which instant talaq is mentioned. But this
                    hadees does not show any Prophetic support for talaq-e-bid’a.
                </li>
                <li>It clearly states that the man who pronounced “triple talaq” did so “without the Prophet’s
                    command.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Implications of verdict</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Biggest achievement for Muslim women, that talaq-e-bid’ain any of his manifestations will not
                    dissolve the marriage.
                </li>
                <li>This renders redundant not just halala but the incorporation of a platitudinous advisory against
                    instant talaq in the<strong> nikahnama</strong></li>
                <li>There is also scope now to amend the 1937 Act, to exclude talaq-e-bid’a from the definition of the
                    word “talaq” mentioned in Section 2, and make the Koranic procedure of talaq gender-neutral.
                </li>
                <li>This judgment will also encourage Muslim intellectuals to establish mediation centres across India
                    under <strong>the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)</strong> mechanism to help Muslim couples
                    amicably resolve their marital disputes
                </li>

                    justice and empowerment ministry on a PIL, urging for a section of the <strong>SC/ST (Prevention of

                    declared as null and void.
                </li>
                <li>The petitioner, alleged that section 3(2)(I) of the said act, providing for the punishment, was
                    <strong>violative of the Constitution</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>Section provided for the punishment if any person, not being a member of the Scheduled Caste or

            <ul>
                <li>Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s directive to tax officials: make every effort to bring all traders,
                    including smaller businesses with turnover of less than ₹20 lakh, into the Goods and Services Tax
                    (GST) net.
                </li>
                <li>Currently, traders with less than ₹20 lakh annual turnover have to register under GST only if they
                    are supplying goods to other States.
                </li>
                <li>PM said he was dismayed at the huge pendancy of tax-related cases where huge sums of money that
                    could have been used for the welfare of the poor were locked up.
                </li>
                <li>He also asked the officers to use data analytical tools to pro-actively track and determine
                    undeclared income and wealth
                </li>
                <li>Mooting a time-bound solution for ‘tax raised and not realised,’ the PM said that human interface
                    must be kept to a minimum in the tax administration’s dealings by pushing “e-assessment” and
                    anonymity of proceedings using technology.

                    bio-film forming bacteria</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>The molecules performed better than conventional antibiotics in killing the bacteria during the
                    dormant phase
                </li>
                <li>When used in combination with existing antibiotics, the molecules reduced the microbial burden in
                    the case of burns and surgical wounds.

                <li><strong>What are Bio-films?<br/>
                </strong>Biofilms are communities of microorganisms that attach to each other and to surfaces and are

        <p><strong>Question 1.</strong></p>
        <p>Anand is the inspector in charge of Rampur Police station. The police station building is in dire need of
            repairs, but hasn’t received any grants for years. One day, a cyclone hits a nearby area, damaging most of
            the houses and shops. Although Anand’s police station gets partially damaged, but most of the building
            remain intact. Government sends a disaster assessment team to ascertain the level of damage and pay relief
            money. The DSP Mr. Prem, orders Anand to do following:</p>
        <p>Hire some laborers and destroy the remaining parts of your police station building. When disaster assessment
            team comes, you tell them building collapsed by the cyclone, and ask them to give priority in funding after
            all police stations is one the most important public offices in a town.</p>
        <p>Should Anand obey his boss’s order?</p>

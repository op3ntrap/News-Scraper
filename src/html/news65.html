                <li>The Government has approved changes in electoral laws to permit Non-Resident Indians to cast their

                <li>Currently, only service personnel are permitted to vote through proxy</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why is proposed facility of proxy for NRIs different from service personnel?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The facility for NRIs will not be the same as that enjoyed by service personnel</li>
                <li>For example, voters in the armed forces can nominate their relatives as permanent proxy to vote on
                    their behalf

            <ul>
                <li>The Election Commission (EC) works in accordance with</li>
            </ul>
            <p>(1) Article 324 of the Constitution of India,</p>
            <p>(2) the Representation of the People Act (RP Act), 1951</p>

            </ul>
            <p><strong>Status of reforms suggested by the EC</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Most of the reform proposals by the EC have not been acted upon</li>
                <li>It sent 22 proposals in 2004</li>
                <li>In December 2016, it sent 47 proposals including those for “Election expenses and election
                    petitions”, “Election campaign and advertisements”, and “Reforms relating to political parties”
                </li>
                <li>There are also instances where the Supreme Court has directed reforms in its decisions, with the
                    government and Parliament attempting to amend laws to prevent implementation of the judgments

            <p>(a) to remove the limit of 7.5% on profits that a company can donate to a political party, and</p>

                <li>A logical and simple way of introducing financial transparency and accountability in the working of
                    the political parties is recommended by the Law Commission
                </li>
                <li><strong>Suggestion:</strong> is to bring political parties under the Right to Information (RTI) Act,
                    2005
                </li>
                <li>The Central Information Commission (CIC) had also said in a full bench decision in June 2013 that
                    six national political parties were indeed ‘public authorities’ under the RTI Act
                </li>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> Because they fulfilled all conditions specified in Section 2(h) of the RTI Act
                    which defines ‘public authority’
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Reaction from Political Parties</strong>: Despite this decision, political parties, including the

            <p><strong>Move to curb Benami Transactions and the use of black money in Property Deals</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The government is planning to make Aadhaar-based authentication mandatory at the time of
                    registration of documents such as agreement for sale, power of attorney,etc.
                </li>
                <li>The government has also firmed up plans to enable electronic registration of properties, for which
                    Aadhaar-based authentication will be a prerequisite
                </li>
                <li>For this, the government is planning to amend Sections 32 and 32A of the Registration Act, 1908</li>
                <li>Also, the Aadhaar law allows the Central Identities Data Repository, under the UIDAI, to offer
                    authentication services

            <p><strong>Expected benefits:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>This is expected to ensure foolproof property titles for the buyers</li>
                <li>It will also minimise the scope of fraudulent and benami transactions</li>

            <p><strong>Other steps taken by the Government to curb black money in real state</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The government also enacted the <strong>Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amended Act, 2016</strong>
                    last year
                </li>
                <li>This law empowers authorities to provisionally attach and eventually confiscate benami properties

            <ul>
                <li>Reserve Bank of India did cut the policy repo rate by 25 basis points, and has opted to play safe
                    while nominally acceding to the clamour for softer lending rates.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Bimonthly policy statement</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It refers to the significant slowdown over the past three months in core inflation — retail price
                    gains excluding those for food and fuel
                </li>
                <li>Monsoon has so far been normal, and the initial roll-out of GST has been “smooth”.</li>
                <li>Monetary policy committee chosen to retain the “neutral” stance, given that it expects the
                    trajectory of inflation to rise from current lows amid a welter of uncertainties
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Chances for Inflation</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Due to the implementation of farm loan waivers by States</li>
                <li>State governments will implement salary and allowance increases following the Centre’s
                    implementation of the seventh pay panel-related hikes.
                </li>
                <li>A second successive normal monsoon that could check food costs and a stable international commodity
                    price outlook — that could help keep the inflation trajectory favourable.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Way forward</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Impulses for growth in industry and services are weakening, so the Centre and the States to take
                    enabling steps, through policy measures and directed fiscal actions, to give a thrust for the
                    revival of private investment
                </li>
                <li>It will serve nobody’s interests if the rate reduction doesn’t have “the desired amplifier effects
                    on the economy” and ends up only temporarily masking the true problems in the banking and real
                    sectors.

                <li>Reserve Bank of India is reviewing the MCLR system and exploring linking of the bank lending rates
                    directly to market determined benchmarks to ensure a better transmission of interest rates.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The experience with the MCLR system</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It introduced in April 2016 for improving the monetary transmission but it has not been entirely
                    satisfactory, even though it has been an advance over the Base Rate system.
                </li>
                <li>An internal Study Group has been constituted to study MCLR system from the perspective of improving
                    the monetary transmission and exploring linking of the bank lending rates directly to market
                    determined benchmarks.
                </li>

            <p><strong>Current problems with monetary transmission:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Banks not doing enough to pass on the full benefit of its rate actions to the borrowers and help
                    revive the sagging private investment for economic growth.
                </li>
                <li>Banks have been selective in their rate cuts in aggressive segments like home and auto loans, but in
                    other segments, borrowers are still tied to the base rate.
                </li>
                <li>Ongoing resolutions on the NPA front will help in better transmission as the banks’ balance sheet
                    stress is resolved.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>RBI plan</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>RBI will be coming out with final guidelines on tripartite repo to deepen the corporate bond market,
                    which, by working as an alternative to the bank lending, will also force banks to tinker with the
                    rates quickly.
                </li>
                <li>RBI is forming a high level task-force to help develop a “comprehensive near real-time public credit
                    registry.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Public credit registry</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It will evaluate the existing public and private infrastructure for credit information, assess any
                    data gaps, study the best international practices and provide a roadmap.
                </li>
                <li>It can potentially help banks in credit assessment and pricing of credit as well as in making
                    risk-based, dynamic and countercyclical provisioning.
                </li>
                <li>The PCR can also help the RBI in understanding if transmission of monetary policy is working, and if
                    not, where are the bottlenecks.
                </li>
                <li>It can help supervisors, regulators and banks in early intervention and effective restructuring of
                    stressed bank credits.

                    <p><strong>The marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR)</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It refers to the minimum interest rate of a bank below which it cannot lend, except in some
                            cases allowed by the RBI.
                        </li>
                        <li>It is an internal benchmark or reference rate for the bank. MCLR actually describes the
                            method by which the minimum interest rate for loans is determined by a bank – on the basis
                            of marginal cost or the additional or incremental cost of arranging one more rupee to the
                            prospective borrower.
                        </li>
                        <li>This new methodology replaces the base ratesystem introduced in July 2010.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Reasons for introducing MCLR</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>RBI decided to shift from base rate to MCLR because the rates based on marginal cost of
                            funds are more sensitive to changes in the policy rates.
                        </li>
                        <li>This is very essential for the effective implementation of monetary policy. Prior to MCLR
                            system, different banks were following different methodology for calculation of base rate
                            /minimum rate – that is either on the basis of average cost of funds or marginal cost of
                            funds or blended cost of funds. Thus, MCLR aims
                        </li>
                        <li>To improve the transmission of policy rates into the lending rates of banks.</li>
                        <li>To bring transparency in the methodology followed by banks for determining interest rates on
                            advances.
                        </li>
                        <li>To ensure availability of bank credit at interest rates which are fair to borrowers as well
                            as banks.
                        </li>
                        <li>To enable banks to become more competitive and enhance their long run value and contribution
                            to economic growth.<strong/></li>

        <div id="The difficult economics">
            <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The hardships faced by Indian farmers on different fronts due to climate, price risk, Government
                    policy problems etc.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Problems</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The risks begin with sowing. The production in the months ahead is deeply dependent on weather
                    conditions.
                </li>
                <li>Price risk: A bumper crop can pull down prices in wholesale markets. Farmers are reported to have
                    not been able to even recover the cost for some crops
                </li>
                <li>Recent report that the fall in inflation has increased the real debt burden of farmers, which has
                    risen faster than real income in recent years.
                </li>
                <li>The opportunities for risk mitigation are minimal.</li>
                <li>MSPs was originally conceived as a way to mitigate risk through guaranteed prices. It later
                    degenerated into a tool to buy the political support of large farmers.
                </li>
                <li>Farmers who suffered losses in the last year have not yet received compensation for 55% of the
                    estimated claims from Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. Crop insurance will not benefit farmers if
                    the compensation is not paid in time
                </li>
                <li>A more robust mechanism is needed to mitigate the price risk. The lack of future prices means that
                    farmers base their production decisions on prices at the time of sowing.
                </li>
                <li>In majority of agri-products, the policymakers used restrictive export policies to keep domestic
                    prices low. This showed the pro-consumer bias in the policy complex
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How to reduce price risk?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Price deficiency payment, which has been advocated by NITI Aayog</li>
                <li>In price deficiency payment, farmers can be compensated through direct benefit transfer if prices
                    fall below a predetermined threshold level.
                </li>
                <li>A deeper derivative market in agricultural commodities will also help farmers in hedging against
                    price risks.
                </li>
                <li>The market regulator has done well by allowing option contracts.</li>
                <li>However, the government should avoid its response of banning trading whenever prices rise.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong> Way forward</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Strike a balance between the interests of both the producer and the consumer</li>
                <li>The actual impact of higher remunerative farm prices can be contained by making markets more
                    efficient and removing middlemen from the system.
                </li>
                <li>Building a common agriculture market is also necessary.</li>
                <li>Government policy should focus not just on higher production but also on helping farmers manage
                    risks
                </li>

                    <li>The Jharkhand Cabinet gave its approval to the <strong>Jharkhand Religious Independence Bill,
                        2017.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Main focus:</strong> discourages conversion to another religion through force or
                        allurement
                    </li>
                    <li>Section 3 of the Bill prohibits forceful conversion.</li>
                    <li>In the event of violation of the Section, there will be up to three years imprisonment or Rs.
                        50,000 penalty or both.
                    </li>
                    <li>If the crime involved a minor, a woman or a person from the SC/ST community, the prison term
                        would be up to four years and a penalty of Rs. 1 lakh.
                    </li>
                    <li>Individuals voluntarily opting to switch to another religion would have to inform the local
                        deputy commissioner/collector about the reasons and the place of conversion, failing which he
                        will be liable for prosecution and punishment.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Key Statistics:</strong> As per the 2011 census, the Christian population in Jharkhand
                        rose by a whopping 29.7% in the last 10 years followed by that of Muslims 28.4%, while Hindu
                        population rose by 21%.

                    <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Centre is about to finalise a fresh version of the DNA Fingerprinting Bill, a draft of which
                            was ready in 2015
                        </li>
                        <li>Law Commission of India released a revised draft of the Bill that is now called The DNA
                            Based Technology (Use and Regulation) Bill, 2017 with some very important changes
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Provisions in news bill:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It seeks to establish regulatory institutions and standards for DNA testing, and supervise
                            the activities of all laboratories authorised to carry out such tests.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Significance of DNA analysis</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is extremely useful and accurate technology in ascertaining the identity of a person from
                            his/her DNA sample, or establishing biological relationships between individuals.
                        </li>
                        <li>As a result, DNA technology is being increasingly relied upon in investigations of crime,
                            identification of unidentified bodies, or in determining parentage.
                        </li>
                        <li>But information from DNA samples can reveal intrusive information like their allergies, or
                            susceptibility to diseases. As a result, there is a greater risk of information from DNA
                            analysis getting misused
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Bill provisions</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It prohibits the collection of any “bodily substance” from an arrested individual (for the
                            purposes of a DNA test) without his/her consent, except if the individual is arrested for
                            certain specific offences.
                        </li>
                        <li>However, if the consent “is refused without good cause”, and a magistrate is satisfied of
                            the need for a DNA test, he/she can order the arrested person to give a sample.
                        </li>
                        <li>The new Bill has also removed a provision that allowed DNA profiles in the databank to be
                            used for “creation and maintenance of population statistics databank”.
                        </li>
                        <li>While the penalty for misuse of data remains a prison term of up to three years and a fine
                            up to Rs 1 lakh, a reference to a minimum prison term of one month has been removed.
                        </li>
                        <li>The Bill seeks to set up two new institutions — a DNA Profiling Board and a DNA Data Bank.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>DNA Profiling Board</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Board, with 11 members, is supposed to be the regulatory authority that will grant
                            accreditation to DNA laboratories and lay down guidelines, standards and procedures for
                            their functioning.
                        </li>
                        <li>It will advise central and state governments on “all issues relating to DNA laboratories”.
                        </li>
                        <li>It will also be the authority to make recommendations on ethical and human rights, including
                            privacy, issues related to DNA testing.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>DNA Data Bank</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A national databank of DNA profiles is proposed to be set up, along with regional databanks
                            in every state
                        </li>
                        <li>The new draft does not specify the location of the national databank. All regional DNA
                            databanks will be mandated to share their information with the national databank.
                        </li>
                        <li>Certain DNA Profiling Board-accredited labs would be authorised to carry out DNA testing and
                            analysis. These are the only places to which DNA samples, picked up from a crime scene can
                            be referred for analysis
                        </li>
                        <li>Data from the analyses will need to be shared with the nearest regional DNA databank which
                            will store it and share it with the national databank.
                        </li>
                        <li>The databanks will maintain five sets of databases — for DNA samples picked up from crime
                            scenes, for suspects or undertrials, and for offenders, missing persons, and unidentified
                            dead bodies.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Issues</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There are chances that a wrong match is generated.</li>
                        <li>If the DNA result is taken as the ultimate evidence, no recourse will be available to an
                            individual who has been wrongly matched.
                        </li>
                        <li>Privacy-related objections-main concerns are whose DNA can be collected and under what
                            circumstances, who can access the database etc.
                        </li>
                        <li>Information like ancestry or susceptibility to a disease, or other genetic traits, is liable
                            to be misused.
                        </li>
                        <li>DNA tests have not led to an improvement in conviction rates in countries where it is
                            already being followed.
                        </li>

                            <li>More than 15 whistle-blowers have been murdered in India in the past three years.</li>
                            <li>The new amendments to Whistleblowers Protection Act, 2014. would fundamentally dilute
                                the law
                            </li>

                        <p><strong>Whistleblowers Protection Act, 2014.</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It protects people who bring to the notice of the authorities concerned allegations of
                                corruption, wilful misuse of power or commission of a criminal offence against a public
                                servant.
                            </li>
                            <li>The WBP law has provisions for concealing the identity of a whistle-blower</li>
                            <li>The law affords protection against victimisation of the complainant or anyone who
                                renders assistance in an inquiry.
                            </li>
                            <li>This is critical as whistle-blowers are routinely subjected to various forms of
                                victimisation, suspensions, withholding of promotions, threats of violence and attacks.
                            </li>
                            <li>The law empowers the competent authorities to accord them protection, which includes
                                police protection and penalising those who victimise them
                            </li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>It seeks to remove immunity provided to whistle-blowers from prosecution under the
                                draconian Official Secrets Act (OSA) for disclosures made under the WBP law. Issues
                                involved
                            </li>
                            <li>Offences under the OSA are punishable by imprisonment of up to 14 years.</li>
                            <li>Threat of such stringent penalties would deter even genuine whistle-blowers.</li>
                            <li>If whistle-blowers are prosecuted for disclosing information as part of their complaints
                                and not granted immunity from the OSA, the very purpose of the law would be defeated.
                            </li>
                            <li>Amendment Bill says that complaints by whistle-blowers containing information which
                                would prejudicially affect the sovereignty, integrity, security or economic interests of
                                the state shall not be inquired into.
                            </li>
                            <li>Certain categories of information cannot form part of the disclosure made by a
                                whistle-blower, unless the information has been obtained under the RTI Act.
                            </li>
                            <li>These exemptions have been modelled on Section 8(1) of the RTI law which lists

                                        <li>Climate change has led to over 59,000 farmer suicides over the last 30 years
                                            in India.

                                        <li>For every 1 degree C increase in temperature above 20 degrees C during the
                                            crop growing season in India, there are about 70 suicides on average.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>The increase in temperature during the cropping season reduces crop yields,
                                            thus resulting in increased suicides.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Additional deaths reported when a single day’s temperature increased by 1
                                            degree C above 20 degree C was seen only during the crop-growing season.
                                            Similar increase in temperature during seasons when crops were not grown did
                                            not result in increased suicides among farmers.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>An increase in rainfall by 1 cm during the crop growing season leads to a
                                            decrease of about 0.8 deaths per 100,000, thus lowering the suicide rate by
                                            7% on average, she writes.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>The effect of climate variation reveals that past growing season temperature
                                            strongly influences suicide rates in the following years up to about five
                                            years. For instance, when there is abundant rainfall during one growing
                                            season, the suicide rates dip for the next 2-3 years. Drought apparently
                                            does not seem to have any effect on suicide rates, she found.

                                        <li>South India which is generally hotter has higher farmer suicide rates.</li>
                                        <li>States where the yields are more affected by high temperatures are also the
                                            States which report higher suicide rates. Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil
                                            Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh not only show severe suicide responses to
                                            temperature but also the crop yield is more negatively affected by higher
                                            temperature.

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>India’s average temperature is expected to increase by 3 degree C by 2050.
                                            Without investments in adaptations, India might face increased number of
                                            lives lost due to suicides.

                                                        have traditionally remained in boys’ exclusive domain, adding to

                                                        between several groups and a law and order problem has arisen.
                                                        The elders after heated discussion have taken a joint decision
                                                        not to allow girls to go to school and to socially boycott all

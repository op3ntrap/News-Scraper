            <ul>
                <li>In a 26-page judgment, the Supreme Court throws points out that human rights and the National Human
                    Rights Commission have suffered a slow death at the hands of the government and the State
                    authorities.
                </li>
                <li>Neglect and stagnation suffered by the NHRC has imperilled human rights in the nation like in fake
                    encounter’ killings of Manipur

            </ul>
            <p><strong>Problems faced by NHRC</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The NHRC, which had investigated 20 of these deaths, was stonewalled for years by the authorities.
                </li>
                <li>It is actually headed by a former Chief Justice of India or judges of the Supreme Court, had
                    declared its own failure and termed itself a “toothless tiger”.
                </li>
                <li>The intention of the NHRC is to more effectively assist the criminal justice delivery system and
                    avoid any factual controversies while respecting human rights.
                </li>
                <li>It is not as if the dignity of only living persons needs to be respected. Even the dignity of the
                    dead must be given due respect.

                <li>The NHRC has to be informed of every encounter death.</li>
                <li>However, these guidelines are given scant respect by the States.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>To combat the alarming rise in caesarean section operations in India, Union Government is
                    considering audit of private hospitals
                </li>
                <li>They will be asked to display the data of normal and C-section deliveries prominently</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Recent step taken by the Women and Child Development (WCD) Ministry</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Ministry has written to Health Ministery asking that it be made mandatory for private hospitals
                    enrolled with the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) to display the data of C-section and
                    normal deliveries
                </li>
                <li>The Ministery has further demanded that the Health Ministry direct State governments to conduct
                    periodic audits of private hospitals to ensure unnecessary procedures are not being conducted
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Increased cases of C-Section Deliveries</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>According to the latest data from the National Family Health Survey 2014-15 (NFHS-4), C-section
                    surgeries have doubled over the last decade across India
                </li>
                <li>The NFHS-4 data revealed that Telangana has the highest number of C-section deliveries in the
                    country, with 74.9% babies born this way in private hospitals
                </li>
                <li>Over 40% of the deliveries in Bihar were C-sections, while 58 % of the deliveries in Maharashtra
                    were through C-section procedures
                </li>
                <li>As per World Health Organization guidelines, 10-15% of deliveries being C-sections is considered

                    <p><strong>What are C-Section Deliveries?</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Caesarean section, also known as C-section or caesarean delivery, is the use of surgery to
                            deliver one or more babies
                        </li>
                        <li>A caesarean section is often performed when a vaginal delivery would put the baby or mother
                            at risk
                        </li>
                        <li>This may include obstructed labour, twin pregnancy, high blood pressure in the mother,
                            breech birth, problems with the placenta, umbilical cord or shape of the pelvis, and
                            previous C-section
                        </li>
                        <li>A trial of vaginal birth in some of these situations, including after C-section, may be
                            possible
                        </li>
                        <li>Some C-sections are also performed upon request</li>
                        <li>The World Health Organization recommends that they should be done based on medical need and
                            in many cases they are lifesaving for the mother and baby.

            <p><strong>Present Scenario</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>In housing sector, massive demand and massive unsold residential inventory is co-existing</li>
                <li>Why: This is the result of pricing mismatch</li>

            <p><strong>Governments Efforts under the ‘Housing for All by 2022’</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The government is collaborating with private builders and developers under a public-private
                    partnership (PPP) model to make ‘Housing for All by 2022’
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Other efforts by the government</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The government has provided 39 per cent higher allocations for affordable housing development
                    vis-à-vis FY17 under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY)
                </li>
                <li>It has also extended the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme to loans of value up to Rs 12 lakh</li>
                <li>Government policies like the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) have infused fresh buyer
                    confidence into the realty sector
                </li>
                <li>The most important decision by government is that it a has granted infrastructure status to
                    affordable housing
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Observation of ICRA </strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>According to the ICRA, the affordable housing segment in India is set to grow at a faster pace than
                    the rest of the real estate sector
                </li>
                <li>Also, it will be the key growth driver for the Indian mortgage finance market</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Positive things that are coming in the affordable  Housing sector</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The segment has lost its “down market” label and become a serious and respectable business sector
                    for developers
                </li>
                <li>It is a given that the demand-supply gap is huge, but the fact is that it is narrowing visibly for

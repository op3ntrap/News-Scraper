                </li>
                <li>This is the case of a biological annihilation occurring globally</li>

                <li>Several species of mammals, were relatively safe one or two decades ago are now endangered,”

            <p><strong>Background Information:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Mass extinction:</strong> The extinction of a large number of species within a relatively short
                period of geological time, thought to be due to factors such as a catastrophic global event or
                widespread environmental change.</p>
            <p><strong>How many mass extinctions have there been?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>There have been five mass extinctions in Earth’s history. Now we’re facing a sixth.
                    <ol>
                        <li>1. Ordovician-Silurian mass extinction</li>
                        <li>2. Late Devonian mass extinction</li>
                        <li>3. Permian mass extinction</li>
                        <li>4. Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction</li>
                        <li>5. Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction<strong> </strong></li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Impact</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>On an average, two vertebrate species disappear every year.</li>
                <li>Tropical regions have seen the highest number of declining species</li>
                <li>While fewer species are disappearing in temperate zones, the percentage is just as high or higher.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Reasons for the decline</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Habitat loss</li>
                <li>Over consumption</li>
                <li>Pollution</li>
                <li>Invasive species</li>
                <li>Disease</li>
                <li>Climate change</li>
                <li>Poaching of tigers, elephants, rhinos and other large animals prized for their body parts.</li>

                            edges. It appears as a deep, red orb surrounded by layers of pale yellow, orange and white.

                        <ul>
                            <li>The draft “Three Year Action Agenda” of the NITI Aayog has been circulated recently to
                                its governing council
                            </li>
                            <li>This draft will be finalised after considering suggestions from the State Governments
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Five-Year Plan</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>After(Union Government) allowing for the 12th five-year plan to phase itself out, the
                                transition is now complete
                            </li>
                            <li>Five-year plans are reminiscent of centrally planned economies; most such countries,
                                like the Soviet Union, China and Romania, had similar planning horizons
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Other documents:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The seven-year policy strategy</li>
                            <li>The 15-year long-term vision</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Objective of Three Year Action Agenda:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It seeks to embark on “a path to achieve all-round development of India and its people”
                                through concerted action.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>What are the advantages of a three-year timeline?</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Electoral cycles do not synchronise with (earlier)five-year plans; quite often, this
                                entailed outcome accountability to rest with a successor government.
                            </li>
                            <li>But a “Three Year Action Agenda” makes the government in office more directly
                                accountable for the implementation of its plans
                            </li>
                            <li>Augmenting the “Three Year Action Agenda” with a seven-year implementable policy
                                strategy and a 15-year vision enables us to look into the future, particularly at
                                evolving technology, demography and ecology, and accordingly align our policies
                            </li>
                            <li>The 15-year vision is also somewhat coterminous with the Sustainable Development Goals
                                (SDGs) of the United Nations (UN). The new format thus combines domestic aspiration with
                                global aims.

                            <li>Japan and China successfully extracted the material from the sea floor off their
                                coastlines
                            </li>
                            <li>Commercial development of the globe’s huge reserves of a frozen fossil fuel known as
                                “combustible ice” has moved closer to reality
                            </li>
                            <li>The fuel was successfully mined by a drilling rig operating in the South China Sea</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Combustible ice is a frozen mixture of water and concentrated natural gas</li>
                            <li>Technically known as methane hydrate, it can be lit on fire in its frozen state</li>

                            <li>For Japan, methane hydrate offers the chance to reduce its heavy reliance of imported
                                fuels if it can tap into reserves off its coastline
                            </li>
                            <li>In China, it could serve as a cleaner substitute for coal-burning power plants and steel

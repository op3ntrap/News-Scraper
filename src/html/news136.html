            <ul>
                <li>The Supreme Court suspended the sale of firecrackers in Delhi and NCR till November 1, 2017 in a bid
                    to test whether a Deepavali without firecrackers this year will have a “<strong>positive
                        effect”</strong> on the health of citizens and a steadily deteriorating air quality.
                </li>
                <li><strong>November 2016 decision:</strong> suspend sales of firecrackers “to test itself to find out
                    whether there would be a positive effect of this suspension, particularly during Deepavali period.”
                </li>
                <li><strong>Key Points:</strong></li>
                <li>Adverse effects of burning of crackers during Deepavali have been witnessed year after year.</li>
                <li>The air quality deteriorates abysmally and the city chokes.</li>
                <li>It leads to closing the schools and the authorities are compelled to take various measures on
                    emergent basis, when faced with a “health emergency”.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Sulphur in fireworks should not be permitted: </strong>Sulphur on combustion produces
                    <strong>sulphur-dioxide</strong> and the same is extremely harmful to health. The CPCB has stated
                    that between 9 p.m. to midnight on Deepavali day, the levels of sulphur-dioxide content in the air
                    is dangerously high.

            <ul>
                <li>Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has announced a slew of measures for women in
                    the state, including a financial assistance of Rs two lakh for remarriage of widows.
                </li>
                <li>The Below Poverty Line (BPL) status would no longer be required for availing the widow pension in
                    the state.
                </li>
                <li>Chouhan also announced a relaxation in the physical fitness parameters for female candidates
                    appearing for a police constable recruitment test.
                </li>
                <li>Sanitary napkins would be made available at 50 per cent rates in the predominantly tribal blocks of
                    the state.
                </li>
                <li>Seeking to ensure the safety and security of girls: school buses in the state would be equipped with
                    CCTV cameras to prevent untoward incidents like eve-teasing.
                </li>

            <p><strong>In news:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Historic verdict:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A three-judge Bench of the Supreme Court, with a 2:1 majority, overruled its earlier orders to
                    conduct matrimonial disputes cases through video conferencing
                </li>
                <li><strong>Bench Observation:</strong> it is very doubtful whether the emotional bond can be
                    established in a virtual meeting during video conferencing and it may even create a dent in the
                    process of settlement.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Rulings:</strong> matrimonial disputes should be conducted in camera in the spirit of
                    Section 11 of the Family Courts Act of 1984 and video conferencing would destroy the privacy of the
                    proceedings and probably defeat the cause of justice.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Earlier decision: </strong></li>
                <li>The majority judgment set aside a decision by a two-judge Bench of the Supreme Court, directing all
                    high courts to issue administrative instructions to family courts across the country to open video
                    conferencing facilities and use the technology to conduct marital disputes whenever one of the
                    parties — husband or wife — requests for it.
                </li>
                <li>The court had said this would spare the parties the drudgery of appearing in person for the
                    proceedings.

            <ul>
                <li>The Supreme Court referred to a Constitution Bench the question whether a Parsi woman can keep her
                    religious identity intact after getting married to someone from another faith under the Special
                    Marriage Act.

                <li><strong>Senior advocates Indira Jaising arguments:</strong></li>
                <li>Denying a woman respect and the right to observe her religion merely because she married outside her
                    faith was violative of her fundamental right to religion enshrined under Article 25 of the
                    Constitution.
                </li>
                <li>A woman’s identity is not merged with that of her husband on marriage, Ms. Jaising argued.</li>
                <li><strong> ‘Doctrine of coverture,</strong>’ which holds that a woman loses her identity and legal
                    right with marriage, is violative of her fundamental rights. The doctrine is not recognised by the
                    Indian Constitution.

                <li>The head of the Indian Council of Medical Research, Dr Soumya Swaminathan, has become the first

            <p><strong>Quantitative evaluation of the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY)</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>One of the main objectives of any health insurance scheme is to provide financial coverage (or risk
                    protection) by reducing such burden while enhancing use of healthcare
                </li>
                <li>RSBY has not been able to reduce out-of-pocket payment for healthcare for the poor, and they face
                    the catastrophic impact of such payments
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>India and RSBY:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Outpatient care comprises up to 70% of total healthcare utilization in India and 60% of total health
                    expenditure
                </li>
                <li>It has by far been excluded from RSBY coverage</li>
                <li>Because OP is not covered, people could delay seeking care until they are more severely ill, which
                    is costly both from the perspective of costs and health
                </li>
                <li>Despite rising healthcare costs, the scheme continues to be capped at Rs 30,000 since 2008</li>
                <li>For a family of 4 or 4.5 persons, this is grossly inadequate</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Positive impact of the scheme</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>One positive impact of the scheme was in non-medical spending</li>
                <li>The poor increased their household consumption level, or non-medical spending, after RSBY
                    intervention
                </li>
                <li>This can be called “virtual income transfer”</li>

            <ul>
                <li>An evaluation of the Yeshasvini scheme in Karnataka by researchers from Delhi University reported an
                    over 70% reduction in out-pocket spending and a 30% reduction in borrowings
                </li>
                <li>Evaluating the Rajiv Aarogyasri scheme in Andhra Pradesh in 2012, the nonprofit think tank Centre
                    for Global Development found reduced inpatient out-of-pocket spending among enrolled families in
                    phase I of the study, but relatively small impacts on outpatient out-of-pocket spending, and
                    catastrophic payments

                <li>RSBY, a tax-financed health insurance that is managed through private insurance companies, was
                    introduced in 2008 for inpatient care to Below Poverty Line (BPL) families
                </li>
                <li>The scheme aims to provide health insurance coverage to the unrecognized sector workers belonging to
                    the BPL category and their family members shall be beneficiaries under this scheme
                </li>

            <ul>
                <li>Consumer Confidence Survey is a survey undertaken by the RBI.</li>
                <li>It obtained responses on household perceptions and expectations on the general economic situation,
                    the employment scenario, the overall price situation and their own income and spending.
                </li>
                <li>It was conducted in six metropolitan cities– Mumbai, Kolkata, New Delhi, Chennai, Hyderabad,
                    Bengaluru.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key Highlights:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The survey indicated that more people see consumer confidence declining, business sentiment in
                    manufacturing dipping, inflation on the rise and growth sliding.
                </li>
                <li>There are two sub-indices in the survey- Current Situation Index (CSI) and Future Expectations Index
                    (FEI)
                </li>
                <li>The CSI slipped further into the pessimistic zone, reflecting deterioration in sentiments on the
                    employment scenario, the price level and income. Same was the case with the FEI which slipped
                    relative to its previous reading in June 2017.
                </li>
                <li>There are five main variables in the survey on which responses from public were sought. These are
                    Economic situation, Income, Spending, Employment and Price level.
                </li>
                <li>7 per cent of respondents say the economic situation has worsened in September 2017 as against 25.3
                    per cent in the same period last year. The response for “one year ahead expectation” shows a decline
                    to 50.8 per cent on the issue of economy “will improve” — down from 66.3 per cent in December 2016.
                    The response for the current perception on the general economic situation showed 34.6 per cent
                    saying “improved” as of September 2017, down from 44.6 per cent in September 2016.
                </li>
                <li>Employment prospects have been the biggest cause of worry for respondents. 7 per cent of respondents
                    believed current perception about employment has “worsened”, which is much higher than the 31.4 per
                    cent in November 2016.
                </li>
                <li>The perception of people on income levels has also come down to 26.6 per cent in September 2017 from
                    37.3 per cent in November 2016
                </li>
                <li>Despite gloomy sentiment on income, more than 80 per cent of respondents reported increased spending
                    over the past year, which could partly be attributed to higher prices.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong> Key Highlights from other surveys:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>RBI’s Survey of Professional Forecasters on Macroeconomic Indicators, said that forecasters have
                    moderated their growth expectation for 2017-18 and 2018-19 in view of tempered assessment of private
                    consumption demand and industrial growth.
                </li>
                <li>Real gross domestic product (GDP) and real gross value added (GVA) are likely to grow by 6.8 and 6.6
                    per cent, respectively, in 2017-18 and at 7.4 per cent each in 2018-19.
                </li>
                <li>The survey also says headline Consumer Price Inflation and Core Inflation are going to grow to 5.0%
                    and 4.9% in Q2 in 2018-19.
                </li>
                <li>On the external front: improvement in external trade in both this as well as next year.</li>
                <li>In another survey- Industrial Outlook Survey of the Manufacturing Sector for Q2 of 2017-18- business
                    sentiment in the manufacturing sector has worsened.
                </li>

                    <p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Mathura School of art</strong></p>
                    <p>At Sanchi, Barhut or Gaya, Buddha was never depicted in a human form but was represented only as
                        a symbol of either two footprints or wheel.</p>
                    <p>Artisans from Mathura initially continued the Mauryan sculptural forms of the Yaksha and Yakshi,
                        until a human image of Buddha appeared, which was independent of other schools of art, but later
                        influenced by the Gandhara School.</p>
                    <p>The representations of the Buddha in Mathura, in central northern India, are generally dated
                        slightly later than those of Gandhara.</p>
                    <p><strong>Influence on Amaravati Art</strong></p>
                    <p>The influence of Greek art can be felt beyond Mathura, as far as Amaravati on the East coast of
                        India, as shown by the usage of Greek scrolls in combination with Indian deities. Other motifs
                        such as Greek chariots pulled by four horses can also be found in the same area.</p>
                    <p><strong>Gandhara School of Art / Greco-Buddhist art</strong></p>
                    <p>Greco-Buddhist art is the artistic manifestation of Greco-Buddhism, a cultural syncretism between
                        the Classical Greek culture and Buddhism, which developed over a period of close to thousand
                        years in Central Asia, between the conquests of Alexander the Great in the 4th century BC, and
                        the Islamic conquests of the 7th century AD.</p></div>

            <p><strong>Case study</strong></p>
            <p>You are recently posted as district development officer of a district. Shortly thereafter you found that
                there is considerable tension in the rural areas of your district on the issue of sending girls to
                schools.</p>
            <p>The elders of the village feel that many problems have come up because girls are being educated and they
                are stepping out of the safe environment of the household. They are of the view that the girls should be
                quickly married off with minimum education. The girls are also competing for jobs after education, which
                have traditionally remained in boys’ exclusive domain, adding to unemployment amongst male
                population.</p>
            <p>The younger generation feels that in the present era, girls should have equal opportunities for education
                and employment, and other means of livelihood. The entire locality is divided between the elders and the
                younger lot and further sub-divided between sexes in both generations. You come to know that in
                Panchayat or in other local bodies or even in busy crossroads, the issue is being acrimoniously
                debated.</p>
            <p>One day you are informed that an unpleasant incident has taken place. Some girls were molested, when they
                were en route to schools. The incident led to clashes between several groups and a law and order problem
                has arisen. The elders after heated discussion have taken a joint decision not to allow girls to go to
                school and to socially boycott all such families, which do not follow their dictate.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>What steps would you take to ensure girls’ safety without disrupting their education?</li>

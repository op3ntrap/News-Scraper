                    <li>Refugees of West Pakistan, who had migrated to India during the 1947 partition, have moved the
                        Supreme Court challenging <strong>Article 35A</strong> of the Constitution.

                    </li>
                    <li>Added to the Constitution by a Presidenial Order in 1954</li>
                    <li>It also empowers the state’s legislature to frame any law without attracting a challenge on
                        grounds of violating the Right to Equality of people from other states or any other right under
                        the Indian Constitution.

                    <li>There were around 3 lakh refugees from West Pakistan but those settled in Jammu and Kashmir have
                        been denied the rights gauranteed under Article 35A which are given to the original residents of
                        the state.

                <ul>
                    <li>After denying the right to privacy for years, the government welcomed the judgement</li>
                    <li>CEO of the UIDAI, asserted, “The Aadhaar Act is based on the premise that privacy is a
                        fundamental right and the judgement would not affect Aadhaar as the required safeguards were
                        already in place.

                </ul>
                <p><strong>Aadhaar and Right to Privacy</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Aadhaar, in its current form, is a major threat to the fundamental right to privacy</li>
                    <li>Common perception that the main privacy concern with Aadhaar is the confidentiality of the
                        Central Identities Data Repository (CIDR). This is misleading for two reasons.
                    </li>
                    <li>One is that the CIDR is not supposed to be inaccessible.</li>
                    <li>On the contrary, the Aadhaar Act 2016 puts in place a framework for sharing most of the CIDR
                        information.
                    </li>
                    <li>It collects biometric information, identity information and personal information.</li>
                    <li>The first two are formally defined in the Aadhaar Act, and protected to some extent. The biggest
                        threat to privacy, relates to the third type of information.
                    </li>
                    <li>In the Aadhaar Act, biometric information essentially refers to photograph, fingerprints and
                        iris scan, though it may also extend to “other biological attributes of an individual” specified
                        by the UIDAI.
                    </li>
                    <li>The term “core biometric information” basically means biometric information minus photograph,
                        but it can be modified once again at the discretion of the UIDAI.
                    </li>
                    <li>One concern is the confidentiality of personal information an individual may not wish to be
                        public or accessible to others. The Aadhaar Act puts in place some safeguards in this respect,
                        but they are restricted to biometric and identity information.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Sharing identity details</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The strongest safeguards in the Act relate to core biometric information.</li>
                    <li>That part of the CIDR, is supposed to be inaccessible except for the purpose of biometric
                        authentication.
                    </li>
                    <li>There is a view that, in practice, the biometric database is likely to be hacked sooner or
                        later.
                    </li>
                    <li>Aadhaar Act puts in place a framework to share it with “requesting entities”. The core of this
                        framework lies in Section 8 of the Act, which deals with authentication
                    </li>
                    <li>Aadhaar Act includes a blanket exemption from the safeguards applicable to biometric and
                        identity information on “national security” grounds.
                    </li>
                    <li>This effectively makes identity information accessible to the government without major
                        restrictions.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Mining personal information</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Aadhaar is a tool of unprecedented power for mining and collating personal information.</li>
                    <li>For example, suppose Aadhaar number becomes mandatory for buying a railway ticket. With
                        computerised railway counters, government will have all the details of your railway journeys,
                        from birth onwards. The government can do exactly what it likes with this personal information
                    </li>
                    <li>By the same reasoning, if Aadhaar is made mandatory for SIM cards, the government will have
                        access to your lifetime call records, and it will also be able to link your call records with
                        your travel records.
                    </li>
                    <li>Nothing in the Aadhaar Act prevents the government from using Aadhaar to link different
                        databases, or from extracting personal information from these databases.
                    </li>
                    <li>Indeed, many State governments under the State Resident Data Hub (SRDH) project, which
                        “integrates all the departmental databases and links them with Aadhaar number”
                    </li>
                    <li>Some of the private agencies do have access to a fair amount of personal information from their
                        own databases.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ol>
                    <li>Reliance Jio is in possession of identity information for more than 100 million Indians,
                        harvested from the CIDR when they authenticate themselves to buy a Jio SIM card.

                        <li>Zika virus is primarily transmitted to people through the bite of an infected mosquito from
                            the Aedes genus, mainly Aedes aegypti in tropical regions.
                        </li>
                        <li>Aedes mosquitoes usually bite during the day, peaking during early morning and late
                            afternoon/evening.
                        </li>
                        <li>This is the same mosquito that transmits dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever.</li>
                        <li>Sexual transmission of Zika virus is also possible.</li>
                        <li>Other modes of transmission such as blood transfusion are being investigated.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Solar wind consists of a plasma of electrons and protons flowing away from the sun at
                            hypersonic speeds. Its existence was first inferred indirectly in the 1950s by observing the
                            shapes of comet tails. Only later was its existence confirmed by the Mariner 2 spacecraft.
                        </li>
                        <li>Comets, on the other hand, are icy wanderers that travel far into space and make an
                            appearance periodically in the skies when they pass close to the Sun. Their shape is
                            characteristic — a small rounded match-head-like halo followed by a long tail — and dictated
                            by its interaction with the solar wind. <strong>The halo and the tail consist of material
                                that has sublimated from its icy nucleus and has been dragged out by the solar
                                wind.</strong></li>

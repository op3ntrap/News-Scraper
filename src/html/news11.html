                        <ul>
                            <li>The Supreme Court upheld the validity of an Income Tax law amendment linking PAN with
                                Aadhaar for filing tax returns and made Aadhaar or Aadhaar enrolment slip compulsory to
                                apply for a Permanent Account Number (PAN) card.

                        </ul>
                        <p>Section 139AA (1) of the Income Tax Act requiring citizens to mention their Aadhaar number or
                            at least their Aadhaar enrolment ID to the designated authority. This provision seeks to
                            curb with the issue of duplicate/fake PANs.</p>

                            <li>Section 139AA (1) was not violative of the right to trade and profession under Article
                                19(1)(g) of the Constitution.
                            </li>
                            <li>Parliament was fully competent to enact Section 139AA and its authority to make this law
                                was not diluted by the orders of the Supreme Court that Aadhaar was voluntary.

                                would face the consequences of invalidation of their PAN ab inito — that is, the effect
                                of non-compliance would be the automatic invalidation of their PAN as if it had never

                        <ul>
                            <li>The government is likely to amend the <strong>draft National Medical Commission (NMC)
                                Bill-2016</strong> to make way for elected members also in the new commission.<strong>
                                National Medical Commission</strong> has been planned as the main regulator for medical
                                sector.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>National Medical Commission (NMC) Bill-2016</strong> has proposed scrapping of
                                <strong>Medical Council of India (MCI)</strong>.
                            </li>
                            <li>The draft bill 2016 also proposes to have separate boards for regulating under- graduate
                                courses, post-graduate, accreditation and assessment board and a board for registration
                                of medical colleges as well as monitoring of ethics in the profession

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Elected members:</strong> the electoral process of appointing regulators is
                                inherently saddled with compromises and attracts professionals who may not be best
                                suited for the task at hand. It creates an ab-initio conflict of interest and therefore
                                this system must be discarded in favour of one based on search and selection.
                            </li>
                            <li>Panel has proposed a fully nominated commission in place of MCI to reform the medical
                                education sector which has been under scrutiny for corruption and unethical practices.
                            </li>
                            <li>Panel proposes a Medical Advisory Council (MAC), with members from states who can be
                                eminent professionals such as professors from a medical colleges and the like. There
                                will be two members from Union Territories. NMC members will also be its members and its
                                role will be advisory.

                        <ul>
                            <li>The MCI has faced criticism from several quarters for alleged corruption in the top

                            <li><strong>The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG)</strong> is a group of nuclear supplier
                                countries that seeks to contribute to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons through
                                the implementation of two sets of Guidelines for nuclear exports and nuclear-related
                                exports.
                            </li>
                            <li>The NSG Guidelines also contain the so-called “Non-Proliferation Principle,” adopted in
                                1994, whereby a supplier, notwithstanding other provisions in the NSG Guidelines,
                                authorises a transfer only when satisfied that the transfer would not contribute to the
                                proliferation of nuclear weapons. The Non-Proliferation Principle seeks to cover the
                                rare but important cases where adherence to the NPT or to a Nuclear Weapon Free Zone
                                Treaty may not by itself be a guarantee that a State will consistently share the
                                objectives of the Treaty or that it will remain in compliance with its Treaty
                                obligations.

                            <li>The NSG Guidelines are consistent with, and complement, the various international,
                                legally binding instruments in the field of nuclear non-proliferation. These include the
                                Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the Treaty for the Prohibition
                                of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco), the South Pacific
                                Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty (Treaty of Rarotonga), the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone
                                Treaty (Treaty of Pelindaba), the Treaty on the Southeast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone
                                (Treaty of Bangkok), and the Central Asian Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty (Treaty of

                        <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
                        <p>Scientists at the Hyderabad-based CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CSIR-CCMB)
                            have developed a novel way to treat fungal keratitis</p>
                        <p><strong>What is Keratitis</strong>?</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Keratitis is the inflammation of the eye</li>
                            <li>It starts with redness and itching and might eventually lead to blindness</li>
                            <li>Cause of infection</li>
                            <li>Keratitis can be caused by both bacteria and fungi</li>
                            <li>Fungi attach themselves to the cornea and release enzymes that break down the corneal
                                proteins for their nutritional requirements
                            </li>
                            <li>In the process the cornea also gets inflamed</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>What are the effects of this disease?</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Corneal damage causes wound and scar formation leading to severe visual impairment</li>
                            <li>It is estimated that about 30% of keratitis cases in India lead to blindness</li>
                            <li>Treating keratitis infection is a challenge because it is difficult to maintain a
                                therapeutic dose at the corneal surface for long periods as blinking and tear formation
                                washes off the drug
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>How does nanoparticle technique work?</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Certain antibodies get attached to the outer surface of the nanoparticles</li>
                            <li>It anchors the nanoparticles to the corneal surface</li>
                            <li>The infected cornea expresses a set of receptors (TLR4) when infection sets in</li>
                            <li>The team has used antibodies to these receptors to anchor the nanoparticles to the
                                cornea
                            </li>
                            <li>In case of severe infection, more receptors are expressed on the cornea and more
                                nanoparticles get bound to the receptors
                            </li>
                            <li>Since they are bound, the residence time in the eye is long</li>
                            <li>Neither blinking nor tear formation washes off the nanoparticles</li>
                        </ul>

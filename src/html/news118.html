                    <li>British government completed a conference on whether measures against caste discrimination
                        should be included in equality law.
                    </li>
                    <li>This was done to ensure there is “appropriate and proportionate legal protection” against
                        unlawful discrimination because of a person’s origins.

                    <li>The first World Conference on Untouchability (June 2009) took place in London.</li>
                    <li>This conference explored versions of untouchability bringing together experts and activists from
                        across the globe.
                    </li>
                    <li>Conference concluded with the <strong>“Conway Hall Declaration on Untouchability”,</strong>
                        which urged all states where such practices were prevalent to introduce legislation to outlaw
                        the practice and undertake programs of education.

                    <li>India’s decision to expand security assistance to Kabul has a nuanced geopolitical message</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Keypoints:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>India’s plans to expand its security assistance to Afghanistan by training police officers in
                        India as part of a UNDP project.
                    </li>
                    <li>By training police officers and hundreds of army cadets and officers, India is taking an
                        important role in capacity building for Afghan security.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The second message</strong>, to Pakistan and other countries in the region that deal
                        with the Taliban, is that India will not be deterred from assisting Afghanistan for its
                        security. This is a clear counter to Pakistan Prime Minister S.K. Abbasi’s recent statement that
                        India has “zero political and military role” in Afghanistan.
                    </li>
                    <li>New Delhi’s decision to send Indian engineers to refurbish several non-functional Soviet-era
                        planes and to repair the helicopters India donated to Afghanistan last year also comes in the
                        wake of this commitment.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Third,</strong> there is a message to the U.S. and NATO forces, India will play a part
                        in putting Afghanistan back on its feet in India’s own way and not necessarily, as the U.S. may
                        prefer, with ‘boots on the ground’ or by sending large numbers of trainers into Afghanistan,
                        where they would become marked targets.

                        sub-lease stations for increasing their investment value and mortgaging assets to allow banks to

                <p><strong>Causes behind the sluggish figures:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The demonetisation of high-value rupee notes in November and</li>
                    <li>The implementation of the Goods and Services Tax</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Situational Analysis:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Increased fiscal spending to provide short-term relief to this problem, as it will not address
                        any of the production bottlenecks in the economy.
                    </li>
                    <li>Any relaxing of the fiscal deficit target will affect India’s standing among global investors.

                <p>R<strong>easons to the current slowdown</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Investors capital on large-scale projects needed to boost growth was held back due to the
                        rigidities in land and labour.
                    </li>
                    <li>The unease involved in doing business in the country and the even larger uncertainty looming
                        around the rules that govern the conduct of business have seriously held back growth.
                    </li>
                    <li>The private investment has failed to make sufficient use of the country’s relatively high
                        private savings rate.

                    <p>Topic: Unemployment<br/> Level: Moderate</p>
                    <p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cyclical unemployment is unemployment that results when the overall demand for goods and
                            services in an economy cannot support full employment. It occurs during periods of slow
                            economic growth or during periods of economic contraction.
                        </li>
                        <li>Frictional unemployment is always present in the economy, resulting from temporary
                            transitions made by workers and employers or from workers and employers having inconsistent
                            or incomplete information. For example, a first-time job seeker may lack the resources or
                            efficiency for finding the company that has the job that is available and suitable for him
                            and as a result does not take other work, temporarily holding out for the better-paying job.
                            Another example of when frictional employment occurs is when a company abstains from hiring
                            because it believes there are not enough qualified individuals available for the job, when
                            in actuality there is.

                        <li>The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) is an index for India which details out the growth

                            India IIP is a composite indicator that measures the short-term changes in the volume of
                            production of a basket of industrial products during a given period with respect to that in
                            a chosen base period. It is compiled and published monthly by the Central Statistical
                            Organisation (CSO) six weeks after the reference month ends.

                        <li>The level of the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) is an abstract number, the magnitude
                            of which represents the status of production in the industrial sector for a given period of
                            time as compared to a reference period of time. The base year was at one time fixed at
                            1993–94 so that year was assigned an index level of 100. The current base year is 2004-05.

                    <p>Large and continuous supply of warm and moist air is the most important condition for formation
                        of tropical cyclone. Where coriolis force is zero (like equator), tropical cyclones do not
                        develop. An upper level outflow of air (and not inflow) helps in formation of tropical
                        cyclone.</p></div>

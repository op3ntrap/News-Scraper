                    <li><strong>Supreme Court observations:</strong></li>
                    <li>The Supreme Court has agreed to lay down the law on whether the Lieutenant Governor (LG) of
                        Delhi can unilaterally administer the National Capital without being bound by the “aid and
                        advice” of the elected government.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Supreme Court has refused to stay the HC judgment, despite submissions by Delhi government
                        that the verdict “affects all future governments and all future relationships between the Centre
                        and the State”
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>HC observations: </strong>The HC had upheld the LG’s power not only over the police,
                        land and public order but also in “services”. The judgment had effectively shrunk the Delhi
                        Cabinet’s girth.

                <ul>
                    <li>The 1996 judgment by the Supreme Court in North Delhi Municipal Corporation versus State of
                        Punjab clearly terms Delhi as a Union Territory in a class by itself.
                    </li>
                    <li>The judgment observed that “the Union Territory of Delhi is in a class by itself but is
                        certainly not a State”. Union territories are in different stages of evolution.

                <ul>
                    <li>SEBI proposed <strong>10 per cent cross-shareholding cap</strong> in credit rating agencies
                        along with a slew of measures for tightening the financial and operational eligibility of their
                        promoters.
                    </li>
                    <li>Besides, the regulator has suggested greater disclosure requirements by <strong>credit rating
                        agencies (CRAs) </strong>as well as by companies getting their services
                    </li>
                    <li>The proposed norms are likely to have an impact on global rating agencies such as S&amp;P,
                        Moody’s and Fitch which have significant holdings in domestic agencies besides their direct
                        presence.
                    </li>
                    <li>Further, SEBI’s prior approval would be needed for acquisition of shares or voting rights in a
                        CRA that results in change in control.
                    </li>
                    <li>The requirement would not be applicable for holdings by broad-based domestic financial

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Estimate by ICRA: </strong>the country’s microfinance sector will grow nearly three-fold
                        to reach up to Rs 4.3 trillion over the next three years on account of expansion into newer
                        segments and enhanced average loan sizes.
                    </li>
                    <li>The estimate includes micro credit across self-help groups, microfinance institutions and
                        banks.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Important observations made:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the ticket sizes were to double from the current levels over the next 3-4 years and MFIs were
                        to increase their presence in under-penetrated areas, the microfinance market could reach Rs
                        3.3-4.3 trillion over the next 3 to 4 years. The assumption on the doubling of ticket sizes is
                        based on improving income levels, inflation, higher eligibility of borrowers moving to higher
                        loan cycles.
                    </li>
                    <li>The MFI sector, excluding Bandhan Bank and teh SFBs, will need external capital of Rs 16-47
                        billion over the next three to four years.
                    </li>
                    <li>While the business opportunity is exciting, there is a need for establishing a credit culture in
                        the new geographies and strengthening the credit appraisal processes.
                    </li>
                    <li>The two operational credit bureaus have helped the sector maintain its asset quality. But there
                        are a few issues yet to be addressed like limited coverage of SHG bank linkage programme data,
                        issues related to multiple identity cards being used by borrowers for availing loans from more
                        than two MFIs and interlinking of retail credit.
                    </li>
                    <li>The overall stress of credit which is due for more than a day stood at 0.35% as of March 31,
                        2016, helped by regulatory decisions like data sharing through credit bureaus, cap of Rs 1 lakh
                        for overall borrowing and the stipulation for not more than two MFIs to lend to a single
                        borrower. However, “communal and political” incidents in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar,
                        Jharkhand and Karnataka did lead to some pressure on asset quality.
                    </li>
                    <li>However, the sector remains vulnerable to asset quality shocks owing to the risks associated
                        with unsecured lending business, political risks, and operational risks arising out of cash
                        handling.

                    <li>NASA has launched <strong>OSIRIS-REx spacecraft</strong> to collect samples from an asteroid
                        101955 Bennu and return to Earth.

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Mission objective:</strong></li>
                    <li>OSIRIS-REx is the third mission in NASA’s New Frontiers program, which previously sent the New
                        Horizons spacecraft zooming by Pluto and the Juno spacecraft into orbit around Jupiter.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Function of OSRIC-Rex:</strong></li>
                    <li>OSIRIS-REx will spend two years travelling towards Bennu, arriving at the asteroid in August
                        2018.
                    </li>
                    <li>The probe will orbit the asteroid for 3 years, conducting several scientific experiments, before
                        returning to Earth, with the sample capsule expected to land in Utah, USA in September 2023.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Scientific Mission Goals:</strong></li>
                    <li>During its three year orbit of Bennu, OSIRIS-REx will be conducting a range of scientific
                        experiments in order to better understand the asteroid.
                    </li>
                    <li>Asteroid will be mapped using instruments on the probe, in order to select a suitable site for
                        samples to be collected from.
                    </li>
                    <li>The aim of the mission is to collect a sample of regolith- the loose, soil-like material which
                        covers the surface of the asteroid.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Facts about Bennu:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Proximity to Earth</strong>: In order for OSIRIS-REx to reach its destination in
                                a reasonable timeframe, NASA needed to find an asteroid which had a similar orbit to
                                Earth. Around 7000 asteroids are ‘Near-Earth Objects’ (NEOs), meaning they travel within
                                around ~30million miles of the Earth. Out of these, just under 200 have orbits similar
                                to Earth, with Bennu being one of these.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Size:</strong> Small asteroids, those less than 200m in diameter, typically spin
                                much faster than larger asteroids, meaning the regolith material can be ejected into
                                space. Bennu is around 500m in diameter, so rotates slowly enough to ensure that the
                                regolith stays on its surface.

                            <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Bennu is a primitive asteroid, meaning it hasn’t
                                significantly changed since the beginning of the Solar System (over 4 billion years
                                ago). It is also very carbon-rich, meaning it may contain organic molecules, which could
                                have been precursors to life on Earth.
                            </li>
                            <li>Additionally, Bennu is of interest as it is a Potentially Hazardous Asteroid (PHA).
                                Every 6 years, Bennu’s orbit brings it within 200,000 miles of the Earth, which means it
                                has a high probability of impacting Earth in the late 22nd Century.

                <p><strong>Solid waste management</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>As per official estimates, at present around 62 million tonnes of solid waste is generated every
                        year and it is expected to reach 165 million tonnes in 2030.
                    </li>

                    <li>“Odour regulation” is still in nascent stage in India. Odorous compounds may have a direct
                        effect on human health. It generally leads to vomiting, headaches, nausea etc

                <ul>
                    <li>It suggested a green belt around landfill sites and advocated for selection of “appropriate
                        plant species for vegetation cover” to assist in reducing odours.
                    </li>

                    </li>
                    <li>The guidelines also batted for initiating legislative norms for creating baseline data on
                        odour
                    </li>
                    <li>Need for gradual shift for installation of Continuous Odour Measurement Systems (sensor based)
                        for getting real-time data.
                    </li>
                    <li>It also outlined challenges to odour monitoring like lack of source-based database on odour
                        levels, low awareness on odour (public nuisance) and lack of legislative obligations
                    </li>
                    <li>It stated that the selection and number of landfill sites for a city should be based on factors
                        like requirement of land for the disposal site by considering the present population and
                        projected growth over the next 20 years at least.
                    </li>
                    <li>Other factors include whether the selected site is free from the influence of other odorous
                        sources and the topography of the site (slope, proximity to water sources like river and natural
                        springs).
                    </li>
                    <li>Selection of landfill site should be integrated with the urban development planning so that even
                        expansions of city in next two or three decades are not encompassing the selected MSW site
                    </li>

                    <p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The new technique of using the bacteria to get rid of oil spill has been called “Oil
                            Zapping”.
                        </li>
                        <li>Oil Zapping is a bio-remediation technique involving the use of ‘oil zapping’ bacteria. It
                            was recently employed to clean up the Mumbai shoreline affected by the oil spill that
                            occurred in August 2010.
                        </li>
                        <li>The Mumbai Oil Spill happened when a merchant vessel M V Khalijia collided with a cargo ship
                            MSC Chitra 10 km off the coast of Mumbai
                        </li>
                        <li>The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board used the services of The Energy and Resources
                            Institute (TERI) which has developed the oil zapping bacteria. TERI had developed this
                            technique over a period of seven years. The Oil Zapping project was supported by the
                            Department of Biotechnology (Government of India) and the Ministry of Science and
                            Technology.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>How does Oil Zapper Work?</strong> There are five different bacterial strains that
                            are immobilized and mixed with a carrier material such as powdered corncob. This mixture of
                            five bacteria is called Oil Zapper. Oilzapper feeds on hydrocarbon compounds present in
                            crude oil and the hazardous hydrocarbon waste generated by oil refineries, known as Oil
                            Sludge and converts them into harmless CO2 and water. The Oilzapper is neatly packed into
                            sterile polythene bags and sealed aseptically for safe transport. The shelf life of the
                            product is three months at ambient temperature. The technique was used successfully and
                            130,000 tons of oily sludge/ oil contaminated soil was treated as per the leading news
                            sources.

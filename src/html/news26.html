                The annual plenary meeting of the Nuclear Suppliers Group in the Swiss capital of Berne on June 22 and
                23 ended without agreeing on India’s case for a membership.

                The 48 member states agreed to convene another meeting on the subject of non-signatories to the Non
                Proliferation Treaty, such as India and Pakistan, in another five months.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Berne meeting:</strong> The NSG had discussions on the issue of ‘Technical, Legal and Political

            <li>
                NSG group granted nuclear waiver to India in 2008 to conduct nuclear business.
            </li>
            <li>
                The NSG said the Berne plenary had “continued to consider all aspects of the implementation of the 2008
                Statement on Civil Nuclear Cooperation with India and discussed the NSG relationship with India”.
            </li>
            <li>
                The “technical, legal and political aspects” phrase in the NSG statement is part of a process decided on
                in 2016, when India and Pakistan had both formally applied for membership to build criteria for
                admitting non-NPT members.
            </li>
            <li>
                India would prefer to see a “case-by-case” basis membership process employed, given it has an impeccable
                record on nuclear transparency compared to Pakistan, which is accused of nuclear smuggling.

        <ul>
            <li>Kovalam has three beaches separated by rocky outcroppings in its 17 km coastline, the three together
                form the famous crescent of the Kovalam beach.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Lighthouse Beach: </strong>The southernmost beach, the Lighthouse Beach is the one most
                frequented by tourists, Lighthouse Beach got its name due to the old Vizhinjam Lighthouse located on a
                35 meter high on top of the <strong>Kurumkal hillock</strong>.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Hawah Beach: </strong>Eve’s Beach, more commonly known as Hawa Beach, ranks second, in the early
                day, is a beehive of activities with fishermen setting out for sea. With a high rock promontory and a
                calm bay of blue waters, this beach paradise creates a unique aquarelle on moonlit nights.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Samudra Beach: </strong>A large promontory separates this part from the southern side. Samudra
                Beach doesn’t have tourists thronging there or hectic business. The local fishermen ply their trade on
                this part.

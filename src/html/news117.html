                    <p>Bharatnatyam dance is known to be <strong><em>ekaharya</em></strong>, where one dancer takes on
                        many roles in a single performance. In the early 19th century, the famous Tanjore Quartette,
                        under the patronage of Raja Serfoji are said to have been responsible for the repertoire of
                        Bharatnatyam dance as we see it today.</p>
                    <p> The style was kept alive by the <strong><em>devadasis</em></strong>, who were young girls
                        ‘gifted’ by their parents to the temples and who were married to the gods.
                        The <em>devadasis</em>performed music and dance as offerings to the deities, in the temple
                        courtyards. </p></div>

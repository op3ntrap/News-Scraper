                    <li>The five-member Supreme Court collegium headed by <strong>Chief Justice Dipak Misra </strong>has
                        resolved to devise a procedure to streamline the process to select judges of constitutional
                        courts.

                </ul>
                <p><strong>December 16, 2015 judgment</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The SC had asked the government to frame a new memorandum of procedure for selection of judges
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Disagreement:</strong> The draft is stuck over a disagreement on the Centre’s insistence
                        on including a “<strong>national security”</strong> clause to enable the government to reject a
                        name recommended for appointment as judge of the SC or HCs on these grounds.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Tussle between Judiciary and Government:</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <ol>
                    <li>The collegium has been firm that the Centre must put in writing its objections, including on
                        national security grounds, for rejecting a recommendation and insists that if the collegium
                        reiterates its recommendation the appointment must go through.
                    </li>
                    <li>But the Centre remains firm it will only show intelligence inputs on a person to the collegium
                        and not put it in writing as this could jeopardise the future of a person whose appointment was
                        stalled because of national security apprehensions

                <ul>
                    <li>The collegium headed by CJI Misra will soon give effect to the <strong>December 16, 2015
                        judgment</strong> of a five-judge bench mandating establishment of secretariats in the SC and
                        each HC.
                    </li>
                    <li>The secretariat will collate data on the track record of persons being considered for
                        appointment as judges and place it before the collegium.

                    <li>The government will launch the much-awaited <strong>direct benefit transfer (DBT) of
                        fertiliser </strong>subsidy in Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, Daman and Diu, Dadra and Nagar
                        Haveli, Puducherry and Goa.
                    </li>
                    <li>Unlike other DBTs such as cash transfer for foodgrains or subsidised gas connection where the
                        subsidy amount is directly transferred to beneficiary accounts, in this case the subsidy will go
                        to the manufacturer or marketing firm.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>No- denial policy: </strong>The government will follow the no-denial policy, which means
                        anyone can buy any quantity of fertiliser after giving details of his Aadhaar card at the retail
                        outlet.
                    </li>
                    <li>Under this scheme, the retail fertiliser outlets equipped with PoS machines will be able to read
                        buyers’ Aadhaar cards. As the farmer buys, the difference between market rate and the subsidised
                        amount will be credited to the bank account of the manufacturer or the marketing company
                        concerned.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>First phase of implementation:</strong> After assessing the success of its
                        implementation and capturing the details of consumption, government will consider to launch
                        phase-II, which will be transferring the subsidy to the accounts of farmers.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Advantages:</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <ol>
                    <li>Records of sales and purchase will bring transparency about the quantity of fertilisers that
                        companies are selling to farmers.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Experts opinion:</strong> this move will reduce the total sale by 10-15% and thereby
                        reduce the burden on the exchequer by about Rs 6,000 crore annually.

                    <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Centre recently approved Rs 25000 Cr modernisation of police force scheme which will be
                            implemented between 2017 and 2020.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Police force modernization:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It will strengthen the law and order apparatus, modernise state police forces and enhance
                            their capacity to combat terrorism.
                        </li>
                        <li>It also has special provisions for women’s security, mobility of police forces, logistical
                            support, hiring of helicopters, upgradation of police wireless, satellite
                            communications<strong>, crime and criminal tracking network and systems (CCTNS)</strong> and
                            e-prisons.
                        </li>
                        <li>The idea is to assist the states to upgrade their police infrastructure, especially in
                            respect of transport, communications and forensic support, to enable them to effectively
                            tackle the emerging challenges.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Funding Pattern:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Centre share 75 per cent while the states’ share will be the rest.</li>
                        <li>Under the scheme, J&amp;K, north-eastern states and states affected by Left-Wing Extremism
                            will get a boost of Rs 10,132 crore.
                        </li>
                        <li>14th Finance Commission’s recommendations increased the state’s share of central taxes from
                            32 per cent to 42 per cent, following which Centre de-linked eight centrally sponsored
                            schemes (CSS) from its support in 2015.
                        </li>
                        <li>While central funding of modernisation of police was stopped, non-plan funding for the same
                            would continued.
                        </li>
                        <li>Thereafter, majority of state governments were disinclined to make any investments in
                            police.
                        </li>
                        <li>But, the Centre again started its funding in internal security with modernization of police
                            forces scheme on the recommendation of Cabinet Committee on Security.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Smart Police</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The PM in 2014 enunciated the concept of SMART police. The smartness has two dimensions
                            external and internal.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>External Dimension</strong> refers to the uniform a policeman wears, the way he
                            carries himself, his weapons, the communication equipment on his person, his mobility,
                            response time, et al. The scheme would enhance his capabilities to respond to and deal with
                            the kind of challenges he is confronted with in his day to day work.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Internal Dimension</strong> refers to the expanded acronym of SMART that is, the
                            police should be strict and sensitive, modern and mobile, alert and accountable, reliable
                            and responsible, tech-savvy and trained. This is far more important than the external
                            dimension but the scheme hardly improves this aspect.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Problems:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Today we have Ruler’s police but what we need is People’s police.</li>
                        <li>Accountability has to be to the Constitution, the laws of the land and the people of the
                            country.
                        </li>
                        <li>The police is being accused of being insensitive to poor and tribals.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Way Forward</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reliability would increase only when the police are objective, fair and impartial. Gadgetry
                            won’t help here.
                        </li>
                        <li>It is the state of mind which matters. And to achieve that state of mind, police must be
                            freed from the stranglehold of politicians.
                        </li>
                        <li>The scheme must be followed by structural reforms, institutions like the state security
                            commission, police establishment board and complaints authority must be set up in every
                            state in keeping with the directions of the Court.
                        </li>
                        <li>The GOI should bring police and public order in the Concurrent List of Schedule VII of the
                            Constitution. Constitutional experts like Fali S. Nariman have strongly spoken in favour of
                            such an amendment.
                        </li>
                        <li>Sustained economic progress needs the solid foundation of good law and order, and we cannot
                            have good law and order in the country unless the police are reorganised, restructured and
                            rejuvenated.
                        </li>

                            to dumping yards is a significant lacuna and highlights the need for smarter integration of
                            Swachh Bharat with urban renewal programmes like <strong>AMRUT</strong>.
                        </li>

                        <li>About 75% of 1.7 lakh tonnes of municipal waste (garbage) that Indian cities and towns
                            generate daily goes to landfill sites or dumping yards untreated
                        </li>

                        <li>Urban issues are state subject and success or failure is determined by public participation
                            and political drive.
                        </li>
                        <li>Cities in southern states have done well simply because there is concerted effort in which
                            local leaders give cleanliness priority
                        </li>
                        <li>Municipalities cannot spend more on collection, transportation and processing of garbage as
                            many are hard put to pay salaries
                        </li>
                        <li>The challenge was of building managerial capacity as well as tapping funds.</li>
                        <li>Financial health of municipalities is poor and it’s almost impossible for small ones to fund
                            treating waste. “Centre gives only 35% of expenses for the entire solid waste management
                            chain. Getting the rest from state and municipality is difficult in most states except a few
                            like Maharashtra. Small urban areas growing fast are hit hardest,”

                <li>The action plan spells out how India will go about handling these issues in a time-bound manner in

                <li>It covers all the issues concerning conservation, ranging from rehabilitation of threatened species
                    to integrating climate change in wildlife planning.
                </li>
                <li>The plan has a road map to deal with poaching and illegal trade of animals and animal parts, and
                    management of tourism in wildlife areas.

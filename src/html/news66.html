                <ul>
                    <li>India’s manufacturing activity in July slumped to its lowest level since February 2009, dragged
                        down by disruptions to business activity following the introduction of Goods and Services Tax
                        (GST)
                    </li>
                    <li>The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) stood at 47.9 in July, down from
                        50.9 in June, and highlighted the first deterioration in business conditions in 2017 so far
                    </li>
                    <li>July also marked the biggest month-on-month decline since November 2008, just after the collapse
                        of Lehman Brothers triggered the global financial crisis
                    </li>
                    <li>This contraction is likely to put pressure on the Reserve Bank of India to lower interest rate
                        at its policy meet.

                    <li>The GST launch, the survey said, affected demand.</li>
                    <li>The reductions in output, new orders and purchasing activity were all the steepest since early
                        2009.
                    </li>
                    <li>However, foreign demand for India-manufactured goods improved in July as new export orders
                        continued to rise.
                    </li>
                    <li>While some business segments have protested against the GST, many are struggling with the new
                        compliance requirements that require them to file at least three returns every month.

                                supplier deliveries and the employment environment.
                            </li>
                            <li>The purpose of the PMI is to provide information about current business conditions to
                                company decision makers, analysts and purchasing managers.

                    </li>
                    <li>The 1970s was the worst decade in terms of loss human and cattle lives due to floods in India.
                        These losses have come down since then.

                    <li>Until the 1970s, damage to crops was the biggest component of economic loss due to floods. Over
                        time, damage to public utilities has acquired the biggest share in flood-related losses.
                    </li>

                                    scheme for jobless youth by flagging off over 100 uberMOTO bikes. Under the scheme,
                                    the state government will provide commercial two wheelers and four wheelers to
                                    unemployed youth at subsidised rates. The scheme will be a game-changer for the
                                    youth of Punjab and will play a catalysing role in encouraging
                                    micro-entrepreneurship opportunities throughout the state. The target of Uber is to
                                    create 10,000 entrepreneurial opportunities in Punjab in one year and a total of
                                    45,000 in next five years.

                                engaged in the business of dredging. DCI is headquartered at Visakhapatnam and it
                                reports to the Ministry of Shipping. Recently, it is in news because a proposal for
                                disinvestment of DCI is under consideration of the Government of India (GoI). The
                                proposal is aimed at upgrading technology, improving capability, infusing capital to buy
                                necessary dredgers and equipments and instilling experienced professional management to
                                optimize the operations of DCI. This information was given by the Minister of State for
                                Shipping and Road Transport and Highways Pon. Radhakrishnan in a written reply to a
                                question in the Lok Sabha on July 27, 2017.</p></div>

                                    <li>Iltutmish introduced Silver Tanka and Copper Jital , the two coins of the Delhi
                                        Sultanate. The coins prior to Iltutmish were introduced by the invaders which
                                        bear the Sanskrit characters and even Bull and Shivalinga. Iltutmish was the
                                        first to introduce a “Pure Arabic Coin” in India. The Coins were engraved with
                                        “The Mighty Sultan, Sun of the Empire and the Faith, Conquest-laden,
                                        Il-tutmish,” after he received an investiture of Sovereign Sultan of Delhi from
                                        the Caliph of Baghdad. The Silver Tanka issued by Iltutmish was weighing 175
                                        grains. Gold Tanka of the same weight was later issued by Balban.

                            cure a currently incurable liver disease that is prevalent in tribal areas. However,
                            developing a variant of the drug suitable for human beings entailed a lot of research and
                            development having a huge expenditure to the extent of 50 crores rupees. It was unlikely
                            that the company would recover the costs as the disease was rampant only in poverty-stricken
                            area having very little market otherwise.<br/> If you were the CEO, then

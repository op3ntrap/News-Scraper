                            making it fair while rewarding the brightest.
                        </li>
                        <li>NEET is seen as elitist, favouring the rich, urban families.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Reasons for getting NEET pattern of examination:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Extortionist policies of private medical colleges</li>
                        <li>Students are admitted on their ability to pay rather than commitment to the profession</li>
                        <li>Weakening standards of high school education</li>
                        <li>Over 30 entrance tests for students to gain admission, making it highly iniquitous and
                            stressful.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Reasons for huge protest against NEET:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wide variance in standards between the CBSE and the SSC</li>
                        <li>CBSE syllabus focuses on science and math and encourages thinking</li>
                        <li>State boards focus on the rote method of learning and liberal arts, worsened by the
                            non-availability of science, english and math teachers in rural areas.
                        </li>
                        <li>The gap has widened further with most competitive exams based on CBSE</li>
                        <li>It implicitly denying students from rural areas and poor families access to professional
                            education.
                        </li>
                        <li>NEET was based on a CBSE plus standard, compelling even the bright CBSE students to take
                            recourse to expensive tutorials for cracking the exam
                        </li>
                        <li>Tamil Nadu has more government colleges and in recruiting students from rural and ensure
                            availability of doctors at peripheral facilities.
                        </li>
                        <li>In pursuing “high standards”, it is apprehended that the IIT phenomenon may be getting
                            repeated.
                        </li>
                        <li>Under the highly competitive IIT system, the majority are in the US or multinational
                            companies and a handful in rural areas or government.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Way forward:</strong></p>

                            unnecessary.
                        </li>
                        <li>Till that happens, the NEET must harmonise the test keeping in mind the syllabus of what is
                            taught in state high schools and the CBSE in order to provide a level playing field to all
                            aspirants.
                        </li>
                        <li>Revive the old system of pre medical course</li>
                        <li>Medical students can be taught for one or two years basic sciences and brought on par with
                            the knowledge levels required for medical education.

                            <li>India is looking to plug loopholes in its Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with South Korea
                                following concerns over a recent sudden surge in imports of gold and related articles
                                from that country.
                            </li>
                            <li>Authorities are also learnt to be probing a possible “criminal angle” behind the recent
                                rapid rise in imports of the yellow metal from South Korea.
                            </li>
                            <li>Certain firms, <strong>“owned and operated by some Indians</strong>”, allegedly misusing
                                the India-South Korea FTA — officially called the <strong>Comprehensive Economic
                                    Partnership Agreement (CEPA) </strong>— that allows duty-free imports of the
                                precious metal and its articles.
                            </li>
                            <li>The authorities are examining a possible criminal angle in such transactions as those
                                entities were allegedly sending gold medallion directly from Dubai to South Korea and
                                then exporting to India, in violation of the FTA norms.
                            </li>
                            <li>Currently, under the FTA, duty-free import of gold medallion is allowed only if it has
                                met the norm of ‘Change in Tariff Heading’ under the Harmonised System (HS) Code — which
                                means one could send gold bars and rods from a third country to South Korea, convert
                                them into medallion (thereby changing the tariff line due to some transformation) there,
                                then export to India and avail the zero-duty benefit.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Key Fact:</strong></li>
                            <li>Gold imports from South Korea had shot up to around $340 million during July 1-August 3,
                                2017, while the same for the entire 2016-17 was just about $71 million
                            </li>
                            <li>India in the bilateral meeting to be held soon with South Korea on trade issues, will
                                come up with a long-lasting measure, push for inclusion of tighter norms in the FTA on
                                imports of gold and its items, to prevent misuse.
                            </li>
                            <li>India will insist on incorporating a clause in the FTA specifying the criteria of (at
                                least 35%) ‘value addition’ as well as ‘Change in Tariff Sub-Heading’ (under the
                                Harmonised System Code) to ensure that the item has undergone substantial transformation
                                in South Korea, and not just routed through that country to take advantage of the
                                duty-free norms under the FTA.
                            </li>
                            <li>Simultaneously, there are also plans to impose safeguard duty (of around 12.5%) on gold
                                imports from South Korea.

                                three-fold jump to $15.24 billion during the April-August period of the current fiscal.

                            <li>Gold imports, which has a bearing on the country’s current account deficit (CAD), stood
                                at ₹08 billion in April-August 2016-17.
                            </li>
                            <li>Surge in gold imports last month contributed to the widening of trade deficit to $11.64
                                billion as against $7.7 billion in August 2016.
                            </li>
                            <li>CAD rose sharply to $14.3 billion — or 2.4% of GDP — at the end of first quarter of
                                2017-18. In general terms, CAD refers to the difference between inflow and outflow of
                                foreign exchange that has an impact on exchange rate.

                                agreement, the government has restricted inbound shipments of the precious metal.

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Catch-22:</strong> India is the third largest coal producer in the world. But it
                                is also its third largest importer.
                            </li>
                            <li>The government has decided to offer 10 coal mines for auction</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>It will break the 41-year old domination of the state-owned Coal India Limited (CIL)
                                over commercial mining
                            </li>

                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Present scenario:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Current regulation restricts commercial operations to CIL — and Singareni Collieries
                                Limited
                            </li>
                            <li>It is the major reasons for the energy-strapped country not being able to tap the full
                                potential of its coal reserves
                            </li>

                        <p><strong>Monopoly of CIL</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Competition Commission of India (CCI) said that monopoly exercised by CIL is “patently
                                unfair”.
                            </li>
                            <li>It is found that CIL and its subsidiaries is “in contravention of the provisions of
                                Section 4(2)(a)(i) of the Competition Act, 2002, for imposing unfair/discriminatory

                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Issues:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Indian coal has about 45 per cent ash, much higher than the 25-30 per cent ideally
                                required for the efficient burning of the fuel in thermal power stations
                            </li>
                            <li>Geological factors are the primary reason for this lacuna</li>
                            <li>CIL’s overwhelming dominance of commercial mining has made the outfit stingy in
                                investing in technology
                            </li>
                            <li>Coal washing, for example — that increases the efficiency of coal. Less than 20 per cent
                                of the coal produced by CIL undergoes coal washing.
                            </li>
                            <li>Thermal power plants also have to reckon with stones in the coal they procure, which
                                adds to their production costs and contributes to the wear and tear of their equipment

                                    <li>Pallava age was a great age of temple building.</li>
                                    <li>It was a gradual evolution starting from the cave temples to monolithic rathas
                                        and culminated in structural temples.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The development of temple architecture under the Pallavas can be seen in several
                                        stages, which started with Mahendravarman I introducing rock-cut temples.

                                    <li>This style of Pallava temples are seen at places like Mandagappattu,

                                        processes such as photophosphorylation, genetic transfer, the transportation of
                                        nutrients, and phospholipid cell membranes.

                                    <li>Phosphorus deficiency can be controlled by applying sources of phosphorus such
                                        as bone meal, rock phosphate, manure, and phosphate-fertilizers.

                                    <li>Bone meal (or Bone manure) is a mixture of finely and coarsely ground animal
                                        bones and slaughter-house waste products. It is used as an organic fertilizer
                                        for plants and as a nutritional supplement for animals. As a slow-release
                                        fertilizer, bone meal is primarily used as a source of phosphorus and protein.

                    <li>President Ram Nath Kovind appointed a commission to examine the sub<strong>-categorisation of
                        Other Backward Classes (OBCs)</strong> to ensure that the more <strong>backward among the
                        communities can access the benefits of reservation.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Key Fact:</strong></li>
                    <li>The five-member panel will be headed by retired Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court G.
                        Rohini.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Reason:</strong></li>
                    <li>Government’s efforts to achieve greater social justice and inclusion for all.</li>
                    <li>Sub-categorisation of the OBCs will ensure that the more backward among the OBC communities can
                        also access the benefits of reservation for educational institutions and government jobs.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Terms of reference:</strong></li>
                    <li>To examine the extent of inequitable distribution of benefits of reservation among the castes or
                        communities included in the broad category of OBC with reference to such classes included in the

                <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Current government promised that 18,500 villages would receive electricity in the next 1,000
                        days.
                    </li>
                    <li>Now nearly 14,500 of these villages have been “electrified”. But more than a fourth of the
                        households in the “electrified villages” do not have a power connection.
                    </li>
                    <li>Saubhagya scheme, launched by the PM last week should be seen in this context.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Features of Saubhagya scheme:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The scheme changes the metric for measuring progress in electrification from the village to the
                        household-level.
                    </li>
                    <li>Beneficiaries under the Saubhagya scheme would be identified using the Socio Economic and Caste
                        Census (SECC) 2011 data
                    </li>
                    <li>Unelectrified households not covered under the SECC 2011 would also be provided electricity
                        connections under the scheme on a payment of Rs 500, which shall be recovered by discoms in 10
                        installments through electricity bills
                    </li>
                    <li>Free or subsidised connections will ensure last-mile connectivity, often seen as among the
                        biggest stumbling blocks to electricity access in the country.
                    </li>
                    <li>By roping in panchayats and other village-level institutions, it ensure that Saubhagya does not
                        remain a top-down endeavour
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Challenges ahead:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Many parts of the country, people face outages for several hours.</li>
                    <li>Ensuring reliable supply requires improving the health of discoms.</li>
                    <li>The UDAY scheme, launched in 2015, has made some headway in improving the finances of the state
                        discoms
                    </li>
                    <li>Saubhagya grants them the freedom to lower tariffs to people covered under the scheme. But at
                        the same time, UDAY makes it incumbent on the states to pay for all the future losses of discoms
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Taking electricity to every household is a great idea. It will need to be done without
                        imperiling the health of discoms
                    </li>

                            and re-engage the region strategically
                        </li>
                        <li>Like in so many areas, China’s strategic advances in the Horn have helped put Djibouti back

                        <li>Things began to change in the 1990s as Delhi turned to economic globalisation</li>
                        <li>Growing commerce resulted in intensifying India’s focus on Africa as a major economic
                            partner
                        </li>
                        <li>India had declared that its national interests were no longer limited to the Subcontinent
                            but stretched from the “Aden to Malacca”
                        </li>

                    <p><strong>China’s influence in the region</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>China’s infrastructure development in the Horn preceded the launch of the Belt and Road
                            Initiative
                        </li>
                        <li>One of the biggest infrastructure projects in the region has been the 750 km-long rail link
                            between landlocked Ethiopia and Djibouti
                        </li>
                        <li>Military influence: China has secured the rights to a base in Djibouti that can host up to
                            10,000 soldiers until 2026
                        </li>
                        <li>This is the first ever foreign military base for China</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Many regional powers are now trying to shape the strategic landscape of the Horn through
                            military bases and armed interventions
                        </li>
                        <li>India is somewhat late in joining the scramble for political influence in this critical

                        </li>

                                driven by digitisation, favourable demographics, globalisation and reforms.

                                growth has been accelerating to 6.9% in 2000s, from 5.8% in the 1990s, and this momentum

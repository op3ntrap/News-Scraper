                <li>Kerala: The Health Department has set up an expert committee to review the clinical management
                    guidelines of dengue fever, after doctors from all government medical college hospitals in the State
                    reported unusual symptomatic manifestations of dengue, rapid deterioration and death in many cases.

                    paralysis and myocarditis.

                <li>Paediatric casualties too seemed unusually high this season.</li>
                <li>Senior virologists have ruled out any mutations in the dengue viruses which may have contributed to

    <div id="‘Scheme">
        <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>According to a report by the CAG, the Centre’s ‘Indradhanush’ scheme to recapitalise public sector banks
                (PSBs) based on their performance was not implemented in a manner envisaged.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Highlights of the report</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>As per the scheme, a portion of the recapitalisation was to be based on the bank’ performance. However,
                this was not followed during disbursal of funds.
            </li>
            <li>The parameters used to determine whether banks required capital changed from year to year and in some
                years the rationale for capitalising banks was not even recorded. Hence, the scheme’s target of raising
                Rs. 1.1 lakh crore from the markets by 2018-19 was not likely to be met.
            </li>
            <li>Also, some banks that did not qualify for additional capital as per the decided norms, were infused with
                capital, and in some cases, banks were infused with more capital than required.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gross NPAs with PSBs had risen sharply in recent years, from Rs. 2.27 lakh crore as of March 31, 2014 to
                about Rs. 5.4 lakh crore at the end of March 2016.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Mission Indradhanush</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>In 2015, under the Indradhanush plan, the government had announced capital infusion of ₹70,000 crore in
                public sector banks for four years, starting from 2015-16. In the first two financial years, ₹25,000
                crore had been earmarked per year with ₹10,000 crore to be disbursed in each of the remaining two years.
                However, credit rating agencies had pointed out that the sum was insufficient as banks needed to meet
                Basel-III norms as well as make provisions for rising bad loans.
            </li>
            <li>The mission includes the seven key reforms of appointments, board of bureau, capitalisation,
                de-stressing, empowerment, framework of accountability and governance reforms.

                Index 2017.
            </li>
            <li>The Index is a comprehensive research that tracks the progress countries have made in developing their
                digital economies and integrating connectivity into the lives of billions.
            </li>
            <li>The Index measures four key drivers – supply, consumer demand, institutional environment, and
                innovation.
            </li>
            <li>With nearly half of the world’s population online, the research maps the development of 60 countries,
                demonstrating their competitiveness and market potential for further digital economic growth.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>What is break out segment?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The ‘break out’ segment refers to countries that have relatively lower absolute levels of digital
                advancement, yet remain poised for growth and are attractive to investors by virtue of their potential.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Performance of India</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>India has been experiencing rapid strides of progress with an evolving payments landscape, catalysed by
                the government’s demonetisation decision.
            </li>
            <li>The government’s endeavour to boost the acceptance infrastructure coupled with a host of other economic
                reforms have further hastened the momentum for the country’s journey towards a cashless society.
            </li>
            <li>Adoption of digital payments has also witnessed a massive growth with a shift in behaviour change as
                more people adopt digital payments in daily life.
            </li>
            <li>With new players foraying into the market and an entire gamut of solutions for alternate payments, the
                India payment ecosystem is growing each day.

        <p><strong>Key facts</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Muntra, the unmanned tank, has three variants – surveillance, mine detection and reconnaissance in areas
                with nuclear and bio threats. It is likely to be used in Naxal-hit areas.
            </li>
            <li>Muntra-S has been developed for unmanned surveillance missions, whereas Muntra-M is built for detecting
                mines. Muntra-N, on the other hand, will be deployed in areas where nuclear radiation or bio weapon risk
                is high.
            </li>
            <li>The vehicle has been tested. It’s surveillance radar, which has an integrated camera can be used to spy
                on ground target 15km away.

            <li>Scientists have identified a new species of <strong>glow-in-the-dark shark</strong> that has an
                unusually <strong>large nose</strong>, weighs a little less than a kilo and measures less than a foot.
            </li>
            <li>The new species, a member of the <strong>lanternshark</strong> family, has been named <strong>Etmopterus
                lailae</strong>. They are not easily visible or accessible like so many other sharks
            </li>
            <li>It lives 1,000 feet below the Pacific Ocean off the coast of the northwestern Hawaiian islands.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Unique features</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Strange head shape and an unusually large and bulgy snout where its nostrils and olfactory organs are
                located.
            </li>
            <li>These creatures are living in a deep sea environment with almost no light so they need to have a big

            <li>Like other lanternsharks, the Etmopterus lailae is bio-luminescent and the flanks on the bottom of its

        <ul>
            <li>China has successfully produced natural gas from methane hydrate, also known as “flammable ice”, in an
                experimental project in the South China Sea. The government has promised to “actively develop” natural
                gas hydrate over the 2016-2020 five-year plan period.

                                      alt=""/></strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Flammable ice consists of methane trapped within water crystals, and has been identified as a potential
                new gas source for China, with the South China Sea thought to contain some of the world’s most promising
                deposits.
            </li>
            <li>Officially known as methane clathrates or hydrates, they are formed at very low temperatures and under
                high pressure. They can be found in sediments under the ocean floor as well as underneath permafrost on
                land. Despite the low temperature, these hydrates are flammable.
            </li>
            <li>By lowering the pressure or raising the temperature, the hydrates break down into water and methane – a
                lot of methane. One cubic metre of the compound releases about 160 cubic metres of gas, making it a
                highly energy-intensive fuel.
            </li>
            <li>Many countries including the US and Japan are working on how to tap those reserves, but mining and
                extracting are extremely difficult.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Importance</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Methane hydrates are thought to have the potential to be a revolutionary energy source that could be key
                to future energy needs – likely the world’s last great source of carbon-based fuel. Vast deposits exist
                basically underneath all oceans around the the globe, especially on the edge of continental shelves.
                Countries are scrambling for a way to make the extraction safe and profitable.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Accessing the power of this flammable ice has been difficult, for two reasons</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>First, these reserves are often distributed over a large area rather than concentrated in one spot as
                oil or natural gas reserves often are.
            </li>
            <li>The bigger problem, however, is that, true to their moniker as flammable ice, methane hydrates are
                unstable and potentially explosive. Drilling into the seafloor could destabilize the methane ice
                crystals and cause explosions, spewing vast troves of methane into the atmosphere, where it is a more
                potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide (CO2).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Future prospects</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Any exploitation of the reserves must be done with the utmost care because of environmental concerns.
                The potential threat is that methane can escape, which would have serious consequences for global
                warming. It is a gas that has a much higher potential to impact climate change than carbon dioxide.
            </li>

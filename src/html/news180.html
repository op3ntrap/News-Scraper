                <li>The Jammu and Kashmir government has hit upon the idea of setting up ‘milk villages’ across the
                    State in an attempt to bridge the demand-supply deficit of milk.
                </li>
                <li>Under this ambitious project of the Animal Husbandry Department, 50 identified beneficiaries of the
                    village will be provided 100% subsidy to establish dairy farm units on modern lines.
                </li>
                <li>The project would also provide an opportunity to Gujjars — the main milk producer’s group — to grow
                    up economically and contribute to the State.
                </li>
                <li>Establishing ‘milk villages’ will not only improve the standard of life of the community, but also
                    boost the economy and social status of the tribe.

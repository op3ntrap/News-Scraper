                    <p><strong>In news:</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Antartica’s ice-free islands:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Within the Antarctica’s continent one can find isolated ice-free nooks — nunataks (exposed
                            mountain tops), scree slopes, cliffs, valleys and coastal oases — which cover less than 1%
                            of the area.
                        </li>
                        <li>These ice-free areas support almost all of the continent’s biodiversity.</li>
                        <li>A paper published in Nature indicates the possibility of expansion of these ice-free islands
                            over 17,000 sq.km (a 25% increase) due to climate change
                        </li>
                        <li>Much of the life thrives in Antarctica’s ice-free pockets: small invertebrates (nematodes,
                            springtails, and tardigrades) vascular plants, lichen, fungi, mosses and algae. They also
                            serve as breeding ground for sea birds (including the Adelie penguins) and elephant seals.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Possible impacts:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Positive:</strong> good news for Antarctica’s biodiversity that is likely to find
                            larger habitats.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Negative :</strong></li>
                        <li>Biggest threats from an increase in ice-free area appears to be the spread of invasive
                            species
                        </li>
                        <li>As ice-free islands expand and coalesce, biodiversity could homogenise, less competitive
                            species could go extinct and ecosystems destabilise from the spread of <strong>invasive
                                species</strong></li>
                        <li>The species that will lose will most likely be those that are not very competitive and can’t
                            cope with the invasive species.
                        </li>

                    <p><strong>Climate change:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The greatest change in climate is projected for the Antarctic Peninsula by the end of the
                            century, and more than 85% of the new ice-free area is believed to occur in the <strong>north
                                Antarctic Peninsula.</strong></li>

<strong>Invasive species:</strong> An invasive species is a plant, fungus, or animal species that &#13;
is not native to a specific location (an introduced species), and which has a &#13;
tendency to spread to a degree believed   to cause damage to the environment, &#13;
human economy or human health</pre>

                    <p><strong>Highlights of study by Jadavpur University</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Study:</strong> Mangrove Forest Cover Changes in Indian Sundarban (1986-2012) Using
                            Remote Sensing and GIS, a publication by the School of Oceanographic Studies, Jadavpur
                            University

                            decades.
                        </li>
                        <li>From 1986 to 2012, 124.418 sq. km., or about 5.5% of the mangrove cover, was lost.</li>
                        <li>Climate change and sea level rise has contributed to the phenomenon of losing land,
                            including mangrove forests in the Sundarbans, in the last part of the 21st century. Mean sea
                            level rise can be considered a driving factor for coastal erosion, coastal flooding, and an
                            increase in the number of <strong>tidal creeks.</strong></li>
                        <li>Sunderbans has lost 3.71% of its mangrove and other forest cover, while losing 9,990
                            hectares of its landmass to erosion in one decade.<strong> </strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Threats associated with mangrove damage:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The continuation of this process(damage to mangroves) in response to climate change and sea
                            level rise poses a serious threat to the <strong>carbon sequestration</strong> potential and
                            other ecosystem services of this mangrove forest in future.
                        </li>
                        <li>A critical minimal inflow of freshwater is necessary for the luxuriant growth of mangroves.
                            When freshwater inflow is missing, there is a change in mangrove succession, and freshwater
                            loving species of mangroves are replaced by salt-water loving ones. Immediate impact of
                            salinity will be on the fishing community, where commercially sought after fish species will
                            be replaced by fish that does not have as much market value.

<strong>Carbon sequestration</strong><span> is the process&#13;
 involved in carbon capture and the long-term&#13;
 storage of atmospheric &#13;
carbon dioxide.</span>Carbon sequestration involves &#13;
long-term storage of carbon dioxide or other forms of &#13;
carbon to mitigate or defer global warming. It has been &#13;
proposed as a way to slow the atmospheric and marine &#13;
accumulation of greenhouse gases, which are released by &#13;
burning fossil fuels.&#13;
&#13;
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is naturally captured from the atmosphere through biological,&#13;
chemical, and physical processes. Artificial processes have been devised to produce &#13;
similar effects, including large-scale, artificial capture and sequestration of &#13;
industrially produced CO2 using subsurface saline aquifers, reservoirs, ocean water, &#13;
aging oil fields, or other carbon sinks.</pre>

Hong Kong, officially the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region&#13;
of the People's Republic of China, is an autonomous territory on the &#13;
Pearl River  Delta of China.&#13;
&#13;
Hong Kong ranks as the world's fourth most densely populated &#13;
sovereign state or territory.&#13;
&#13;
Hong Kong and China:&#13;
After the First Opium War (1839–42), Hong Kong became a British colony.&#13;
&#13;
Hong Kong was later occupied by Japan during World War II until British control resumed in 1945.&#13;
&#13;
In the early 1980s, negotiations between the United Kingdom and China resulted in the 1984 &#13;
Sino-British Joint Declaration, which paved way for the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong &#13;
in 1997, when it became a special administrative  region (SAR) of the Peoples Republic of China with &#13;
a high degree of autonomy.&#13;
&#13;
Under the principle of "one country, two systems",Hong Kong maintains a separate political and&#13;
economic system from China. Except in military defence and foreign affairs, Hong Kong maintains its &#13;
independent executive, legislative and judiciary powers. &#13;
&#13;
In addition, Hong Kong develops relations directly with foreign states and international organisations &#13;
in a broad range of "appropriate fields". </pre>

                                    into the world’s water.

                                <li><strong>Catalyst synthesis:</strong> By heating the reaction mixture at high
                                    pressures inside a sealed container, the composite is synthesised by growing
                                    ultrathin “nanowires” of tungsten oxide on the surface of tiny particles of tantalum
                                    nitride.
                                </li>
                                <li>The composite provides a huge surface area for dye capture(incredibly small size of
                                    the two material components- typically less than 40 billionths of a metre in
                                    diameter)
                                </li>
                                <li>The material then proceeds to break the dye down into smaller, harmless molecules
                                    using the energy provided by sunlight, in a process known as “<strong>photocatalytic
                                        degradation</strong>.”

                                <li>Having removed the harmful dyes, the catalyst may simply be filtered from the
                                    cleaned water and reused.

                                        2008, institutionalises prisoner exchange between the two countries.
                                        Accordingly, lists of nationals lodged in jails are to be exchanged twice each
                                        year, on January 1 and July 1.</p></div>

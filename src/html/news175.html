            <ul>
                <li>“Araku Balloon Festival”, an international festival organised by Andhra Pradesh Tourism</li>
                <li>The event is aimed at showcasing the Araku Valley – known for its panoramic views of the Eastern
                    Ghats, the coffee plantations, and the waterfalls – as a tourist destination. It has drawn scores of
                    travellers, photography enthusiasts, and media from across the country.
                </li>

                    and night on all the three days and enthusiasts would get to witness balloons of different shapes
                    and sizes adorn the sky in the non-ticketed festival.

        </p>
        <div id="Post-Doklam">
            <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Displaying convergence of interests with the new quadrilateral grouping with U.S., Japan and
                    Australia, India reached out to China’s backyard, addressing an array of issues ranging from the
                    tension in the Korean peninsula to freedom of navigation and sought a crackdown on chemical weapons
                    during the ASEAN and the East Asia summits.
                </li>
                <li>A high-level Indian official told The Hindu that New Delhi has emerged as a more dependable partner
                    for South-East Asia following the Doklam faceoff with China, and indicated that the South-East Asian
                    countries expect New Delhi to be assertive with Beijing.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Issue Area</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>India remains concerned about China’s manmade structures in the South China Sea that are likely to
                    create navigational problems and international friction
                </li>
                <li>Southeast Asian region had been facing uncertainties following the exit of President Barack Obama as
                    he took visible interest in the region.
                </li>
                <li>However, the latest visits by the leaders of the quadrilateral countries, including by the new U.S.
                    President Donald Trump have once again assured support to these countries as they face China’s
                    commercial and military domination.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Other issues discussed</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared concerns of DPRK’s pursuit of missiles and nuclear weapons and
                    called for complete verification and irreversible denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.
                </li>
                <li>He also said that North Korea’s proliferation links must be investigated and the parties who have
                    supported these unlawful programmes must be made accountable
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><span><strong>Basic Information:</strong></span></p>
            <p><strong>Quadrilateral grouping</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QSD) was an informal strategic dialogue between the United
                    States, Japan, Australia and India that was maintained by talks between member countries.
                </li>
                <li>The dialogue was initiated in 2007 by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, with the support of Vice
                    President Dick Cheney of the US, Prime Minister John Howard of Australia and Prime Minister Manmohan
                    Singh of India.
                </li>
                <li>Japan President Shinzo Abe delivered a speech to the Indian Parliament in August 2007, entitled a
                    “confluence of the two seas”, a phrase he took from the title of a book written by Mughal prince
                    Dara Shikoh.
                </li>
                <li>The dialogue was paralleled by joint military exercises of an unprecedented scale, titled Exercise
                    Malabar.
                </li>
                <li>The diplomatic and military arrangement was widely viewed as a response to increased Chinese
                    economic and military power, and the Chinese government responded to the Quadrilateral dialogue by
                    issuing formal diplomatic protests to its members.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What was the intention?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The initiation of an American, Japanese, Australian and Indian defense arrangement, modeled on the
                    concept of a Democratic Peace
                </li>
                <li>The Quadrilateral was supposed to establish an “Asian Arc of Democracy,” envisioned to ultimately
                    include countries in central Asia, Mongolia, the Korean peninsula, and other countries in Southeast
                    Asia: “virtually all the countries on China’s periphery, except for China itself.”
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>ASEAN meeting</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Convened around the theme of a “free and open Indo-Pacific,” the first quadrilateral meeting
                    addressed seven core themes: the rules-based order in Asia, freedom of navigation and overflight in
                    the maritime commons, respect for international law, enhancing connectivity, maritime security, the
                    North Korean threat and nonproliferation, and terrorism.
                </li>
                <li>The agreements on terror financing, chemical weapons and de-radicalisation adopted at the East Asia
                    Summit will help the region cope with the threat of terrorism effectively in future.
                </li>

            <p><strong>Drawbacks</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Quadrilateral was viewed as an “Asian NATO;”</li>
                <li>Daniel Twining of the German Marshall Fund of the United States has written that the arrangement
                    “could lead to military conflict,” or could instead “lay an enduring foundation for peace” if China
                    becomes a democratic leader in Asia.

            <p><strong>In news:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Supreme Court dismissed a petition filed by advocate Kamini Jaiswal seeking a Special
                    Investigation Team probe in the medical college bribery case as an effort to “create ripples” within
                    the apex court by throwing scandalous allegations at Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The case, which the Central Bureau of Investigation is looking into, involves allegations that
                    former members of the higher judiciary took bribes to manipulate court orders in favour of medical
                    colleges that had failed to get official registrations.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Controversy in Supreme Court:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Jaiswal’s petition was mentioned before a two-judge bench headed by Justice Chelameswar for urgent
                    hearing. The judge decided to take up the petition.
                </li>
                <li>This bench referred the matter to a larger five-judge Constitution bench on November 13.</li>
                <li>The petitioners had said that the bench should exclude Chief Justice Dipak Misra, who handled cases
                    related to the Medical Council of India earlier this year, as there would be a conflict of interest.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Progress:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>However, a Constitution bench led by Chief Justice Dipak Misra, in an unprecedented hearing,
                    nullified Justice Chelameswar’s order
                </li>
                <li>The bench had said “the chief justice is the master of the roster” and no other judges of the
                    Supreme Court can constitute benches.
                </li>
                <li>Future</li>
                <li>On November 11, the Supreme Court even issued a circular that from now on, all unassigned or
                    unlisted cases can be mentioned only before the chief justice of India.

                <li>‘India State-Level Disease Burden,’ has revealed severe inequalities in the disease burden in
                    different States.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Life Expectancy</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Life expectancy at birth in the country improved significantly during 1990 to 2016 — from 59.7 years
                    and 58.3 years for females and males respectively in 1990 to 70.3 years for females and 66.9 years
                    for males in 2016.
                </li>
                <li>But in a measure of the continuing inequalities, the life expectancy for females in Uttar Pradesh
                    was 66.8 years — below the national average and 12 years less than in Kerala, where it was 78.7
                    years.
                </li>
                <li>Again, men in Kerala enjoyed a life expectancy of 73.8 years, but the corresponding figure for men
                    in Assam was 63.6 years.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Under five morality</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The study found that while under-5 mortality was improving in every State, there was a four-fold
                    difference in the rate of improvement among States, which again indicated health inequalities.

                <li>With winter setting in, migratory birds have started to arrive at Odisha’s Chilika Lake, the largest
                    brackish water lagoon in the country
                </li>
                <li>Avian guests from north, central and east Siberia, China, Mongolia, west Asian countries and the
                    Himalayan region of India reach Chilika every year during winter months.
                </li>
                <li>The Nalabana island and its adjoining areas, spread over 15 sqkm inside the large lake, is a major
                    perching region for these migratory birds
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Delayed arrival</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>This year, the arrival of migratory birds was slightly delayed due to climatic conditions. Usually
                    the birds arrive at the lake in the second fortnight of October, but this year they started flocking
                    in the beginning of November.
                </li>
                <li>Fall in atmospheric temperature was slightly late in this part of the country.</li>
                <li>Added to that, sporadic rainfall that continued till October kept high patches and vegetation of the
                    lake submerged.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong> </strong><strong>Where are they dispersed?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>At present, the migratory birds are perching in areas where the water level is comparatively low and
                    mud patches are visible.
                </li>
                <li>Birds like waders are mostly seen at mud patches, while ducks are being sighted in areas of shallow
                    water.
                </li>
                <li>The other bird varieties that are being sighted in large numbers in the lake include pintails,
                    gadwals, shovellers, rudy shelducks and pratincoles among others.
                </li>

            <p><strong>Bird-protection camps</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>As many as 19 bird-protection camps have been set up by the Forest Department at Nalabana sanctuary
                    and other areas around Chilika Lake.
                </li>
                <li>Around 30 former bird poachers, were arrested by the Forest Department in the past, are part of
                    these bird-protection camps.
                </li>
                <li>No boats, except for two power boats of the Forest Department, are being allowed to enter the
                    sanctuary area.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Nalbana Bird Sanctuary</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Nalbana Bird Sanctuary or Nalbana Island is the core area of the Ramsar designated wetlands of
                    Chilika Lake.
                </li>
                <li>It was declared a bird sanctuary under the Wildlife Protection Act in 1973</li>
                <li>In the heart of the park, one can see thousands of birds descending during the migratory season. The
                    island disappears during monsoon season due to inundation only to emerge again in post-monsoon.
                </li>
                <li>Nalbana means a weed covered island In the Odia language.</li>
                <li>Nalbana was notified in 1987 and declared a bird sanctuary in 1973 under the Wildlife Protection
                    Act
                </li>
                <li>In 2002, The Bombay Natural History Society survey recorded 540 nests of the Indian river tern at

                    <li>Carbon nanotubes have been used in planes for their strength – they are stronger than steel –
                        and their ability to conduct heat. However, BNNTs are the wave of the future when it comes to
                        air travel.
                    </li>
                    <li>While carbon nanotubes can stay stable at temperatures up to 400 degrees Celsius, BNNTs can
                        withstand up to 900 degrees Celsius
                    </li>
                    <li>BNNTs are also able to handle high amounts of stress and are extremely lightweight</li>
                    <li>Withstanding high temperatures is an important requirement for any material meant to build the

            <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The demand for <strong>independent religion status</strong> for Lingayats once again gathered new
                    momentum.
                </li>
                <li>Lakhs of people belonging to Lingayat community took to the streets in Bidar – Karnataka.</li>
                <li>Their anger was not just against those who projected Lingayat community as an integral part of
                    Hinduism but also those who argued Lingayat and Veerashaiva were one and the same.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Lingayat and Veerashaiva</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The heads of the different Lingayat mutts who arrived from different parts of the country to
                    participate in the agitation invariably asserted that Lingayats had been neither part of the Hindu
                    religion nor were a synonym for the Veerashaiva sect.
                </li>
                <li>There are two main religious streams in Hinduism — <strong>Shaivas and Vaishnavas</strong>.
                    Veerashaiva is one among the seven sects of Shaivas. Both Shaivas and Vaishnavas uphold Vedas,
                    Agamas, Shastras and Puranas and follow the Vedic religious practices. However, Lingayat religion
                    founded by Basaveshwara vehemently opposed them.
                </li>
                <li>Lingayats are spread across Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and other States.
                    Historically, ours is an independent religion founded by Basaveshwara in the 12th century. It has
                    never been a part of Hinduism. Contrarily, it fought Hinduism.

        <div id="Get">
            <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Despite the most stringent penal provisions in the law against manual scavenging, it continues in
                    parts of India.
                </li>
                <li>Recently Madras High Court ordered the Centre and the Tamil Nadu government to ensure the strict
                    enforcement of the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act,
                    2013, in the wake of the death of 30 people engaged in the activity in the State.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Current Issue</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Vigorous national campaign for the rehabilitation of those engaged to manually clean insanitary
                    latrines, and urban structures into which human excreta flows without sewerage, has been unable to
                    break governmental indifference and social prejudice.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why manual scavenging still persists?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Because of the continued presence of insanitary latrines, of which there are about 2.6 million that
                    require cleaning by hand.
                </li>
                <li>In spite of a legal obligation, State governments are not keen to demolish and rebuild old
                    facilities lacking sanitation.
                </li>
                <li>Government hasn’t conducted a full census of both the latrines and the people engaged in clearing
                    such waste.
                </li>
                <li>The Central government, which runs the self-employment scheme for the rehabilitation of these
                    workers, has reduced funds from ₹448 crore in the 2014-15 budget to ₹5 crore this year.
                </li>
                <li>Even high allocation in the past also did not utilise effectively.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Social prejudices that impedes solutions</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Many communities still regard the inclusion of a sanitary toilet as ritual and physical pollution of
                    the house.
                </li>
                <li>Even the less conservative are ready to accept only large, expensive and unscientific structures
                    much bigger than those recommended by the WHO
                </li>
                <li>Entrenched belief in the caste system, that assumes Dalits will readily perform the stigmatised task
                    of emptying latrines.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Way forward:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Effective implementation of the law requires willingness of the courts to fix responsibility on
                    State governments, and order an accurate survey of the practice especially in those States that
                    claim to have no insanitary latrines or manual scavenging.
                </li>
                <li>Raising the confidence level among those engaged in manual cleaning, even official data show their
                    reluctance to take up self-employment.
                </li>
                <li>Empowerment holds the key to change.</li>
                <li>Break the caste barriers through education and economic uplift.</li>
                <li>Compensation for the families of those who died in the course of the humiliating and hazardous work
                    should be paid immediately.
                </li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Right to privacy is not absolute and cannot prevent the state from making laws imposing
                    reasonable restrictions on citizens.</strong></li>
                <li>‘Right to privacy’ is too ‘amorphous’ a term. To recognise privacy as a definite right, it has to
                    first define it. But this would be nearly impossible as an element of privacy pervades all the
                    fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution.
                </li>
                <li>An attempt to define the right to privacy may cause more harm than good.</li>
                <li>An exhaustive cataloguing by the court of what all constitutes privacy may limit the right itself.

            <p><strong>Attorney-General response:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>‘A common law’:</strong> right to privacy is merely a common law right and the Constitution
                    makers “consciously avoided” making it a part of the fundamental right.

            <p><strong>Radical ‘privatisation project’</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Union Health Ministry and the NITI Aayog have developed a framework to let <strong>private
                    hospitals</strong> run select services within district hospitals, on a 30-year lease.
                </li>
                <li>Framework prepares in consultation with the World Bank.</li>
                <li><strong>The government will be allowing a single private partner or a single consortium of private
                    partners to bid for space in district level hospitals, especially in tier 2 &amp; 3 cities.</strong>
                </li>
                <li>Under this Public Private Partnership (PPP), care for only three non-communicable diseases — cardiac
                    disease, pulmonary disease, and cancer care — will be provided.
                </li>
                <li>According to the draft model contract, private hospitals will bid for 30-year leases over portions
                    of district hospital buildings to set up 50- or 100-bed hospitals in smaller towns across the
                    country. The State governments could lease up to five or six district hospitals within the State.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Viability gap funding: </strong>the State governments will give Viability Gap Funding (VGF),
                    or one-time seed money, to private players to set up infrastructure within district hospitals. The
                    private parties and State health departments will share ambulance services, blood banks, and
                    mortuary services.
                </li>
                <li>There will be no reserved beds or no quota (sic) of beds for free services in these facilities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Criticism:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The policy document has come under sharp criticism for the Ministry’s failure to consult with key
                    stakeholders from civil society and academia.
                </li>
                <li>The government is planning to hand over critical public assets without gaining anything much in
                    return.
                </li>
                <li>NITI Aayog has no locus standi to make health policy, which is a state subject in India. <strong>The
                    logic behind shutting down the Planning Commission was to ensure that policies are not
                    centralised</strong>. NITI Aayog was to be an advisory body but here they are rushing through a
                    policy that will essentially hand over public assets to the private sector, leading to a further
                    dismantling of the public services available for free.
                </li>
                <li>Only Below Poverty Line (BPL) patients and those in insurance schemes will be able to access free
                    care. This would effectively <strong>exclude</strong> hundreds of millions of the Indian population
                    from vital hospital services.

                <li>India has a “critical role” to play in breaking the stalemate in Afghanistan.</li>
                <li>It also pitched for enhancing trilateral cooperation among Afghanistan, India and the U.S.</li>
                <li>In a report accompanying the National Defence Authorisation Act (NDAA) 2018, the committee also
                    called for enhancing the overall defence cooperation between the U.S. and India, and eventually
                    joint naval patrol of the Indian Ocean.
                </li>
                <li>The Senate Committee also pulled up the Department of Defence for not making faster progress in

                    stability and security.
                </li>
                <li>The committee believes that the United States needs to recommit to the fight in Afghanistan and that
                    India, as a major defence partner of the United States and a contributor to regional security, has a
                    critical role to play in this effort.

            <div id="World’s">
                <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bleaching has damaged the world’s northernmost coral reef in Japan, the latest example of a
                        global phenomenon scientists have attributed to high ocean temperatures.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Coral bleaching</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>About 30% of the coral reef off the coast of <strong>Tsushima island</strong> in Japan, which
                        lies in the temperate zone some 1,000 km southwest of Tokyo, suffered bleaching
                    </li>
                    <li>Early in 2017, the rise in water temperature caused significant bleaching in the Great Barrier
                        Reef in Australia for the second consecutive year.
                    </li>
                    <li>Since 2015, all tropical coral reefs have seen above-normal temperatures, and more than 70%
                        experienced prolonged high temperatures that can cause bleaching.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Coral reef-advantages:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Healthy coral reefs protect shores from storms.</li>
                    <li>Offer habitats for fish and other marine life, including ecologically and economically important
                        species.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Recovery option:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>After coral dies, reefs quickly degrade and the structures that coral build erode. While coral
                        can recover from mild bleaching, severe or long-term episodes are often lethal.
                    </li>
                    <li>According to U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration coral reef bleaching may be
                        easing after the three years of high ocean temperatures, the longest such period since the
                        1980s.
                    </li>
                    <li>Satellite data showed widespread bleaching was no longer occurring in all three ocean basins —
                        Atlantic, Pacific and Indian —“indicating a likely end to the global bleaching event”.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Basic Information: </strong></p>
                <p><strong>Coral reefs</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Coral reefs are large underwater structures composed of the skeletons of coral, which are marine
                        invertebrate animals.
                    </li>
                    <li>The coral species that build coral reefs are known as hermatypic or “hard” corals because they
                        extract calcium carbonate from seawater to create a hard, durable exoskeleton that protects
                        their soft, sac-like bodies.
                    </li>
                    <li>Each individual coral is referred to as a polyp. New coral polyps live on the calcium carbonate
                        exoskeletons of their ancestors, adding their own exoskeleton to the existing coral structure.
                    </li>

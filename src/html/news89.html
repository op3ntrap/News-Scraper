                <li>Purnachandra Rao, Director, National Centre for Earth Science Studies in his speech said, geological
                    stresses building along the Indo-Australian tectonic plate boundary in the Southern Indian Ocean
                    have the potential to cause a powerful earthquake up to a magnitude of 8, triggering a tsunami
                    across much of South India.
                </li>
                <li>The largest <strong>strike-slip earthquake</strong> on record had happened along the <strong>Indo-Australian
                    plate boundary</strong> in 2012.The phenomenon occurred when tectonic plates slipped horizontally
                    along a fault line, unlike most large earthquakes which were caused when two plates collided at
                    their boundaries and one plate slid beneath the other.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key Facts</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Burmese Arc</strong>, north of the <strong>Andaman islands</strong>, had been identified as
                    another region with the potential to generate a quake triggered tsunami that could affect Bangladesh
                    and devastate the northern Bay of Bengal.
                </li>
                <li>The <strong>Andaman subduction zone</strong> in the <strong>Bay of Bengal</strong> and the <strong>Makaran
                    subduction zone</strong> in <strong>the Arabian Sea</strong> were the other tsunamigeic zones in the
                    Indian plate region.

                    <p><strong>Appointment</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Article 124</strong> of the Constitution of India provides for the manner of appointing
                        judges to the Supreme Court. Though <strong>no specific provision exists in the
                            Constitution</strong> for appointing the Chief Justice, who, as a result, is appointed like
                        the other judges conventionally, the outgoing CJI recommends the name of the senior-most judge
                        (i.e. by date of appointment to the Supreme Court) for appointment by the President of India, as
                        his successor.</p>
                    <p><strong>Seniority at the apex court is determined not by age, but by:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The date a judge was appointed to the Supreme Court.</li>

                                    court service would ‘win’ in the seniority stakes;

                                <li>An appointment from the bench would ‘trump’ in seniority an appointee from the

                            of a Judge of Supreme Court which is applicable to Chief Justice as well. Once appointed,
                            the Chief Justice remains in office until the age of 65 years. He can be removed only
                            through a process of <strong>impeachment by Parliament</strong> as follows:
                        </li>

                            total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members
                            of that House present and voting has been presented to the President in the same session for

            <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Government decided that it does not agree Jamia as a ‘minority’ institution.</li>
                <li>Center replied Delhi High Court that it does not back an order by the National Commission for
                    Minority Educational Institutions (NCMEI) that had declared Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) as a
                    religious minority institution (six years ago).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>“Jamia was established by the Muslims for the advantage of Muslims and it never lost its identity as
                    a Muslim minority educational institution” says NCMEI.
                </li>
                <li>An order in the past led JMI to scrap reservations for SC/ST and OBC students and set aside half the
                    seats in each course for Muslims.
                </li>
                <li>After the order was challenged in court, the previous UPA government submitted an affidavit saying
                    it “respects the declaration made by NCMEI”.
                </li>
                <li>On the advise of then Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, the NDA government, under HRD Ministry under
                    Smriti Irani entitled to change the government’s view and took a stance that JMI is not a minority
                    institution.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What is a minority educational institution?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A minority educational institution is one that has been set up by either a linguistic or a religious
                    minority group.
                </li>
                <li>Objective: To keep alive and foster what it considers its unique and special features.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Does the Constitution provide for minority educational institutions?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fundamental Rights, Part III, openly provides for the right.</li>
                <li>Article 30, titled “Right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions”, says:
                    <ul>
                        <li>“(1) All minorities, whether based on religion or language, shall have the right to
                            establish and administer educational institutions of their choice
                        </li>
                        <li>(1A) In making any law providing for the compulsory acquisition of any property of an
                            educational institution established and administered by a minority, referred to in clause
                            (1), the State shall ensure that the amount fixed by or determined under such law for the
                            acquisition of such property is such as would not restrict or abrogate the right guaranteed
                            under that clause
                        </li>
                        <li>(2) The state shall not, in granting aid to educational institutions, discriminate against
                            any educational institution on the ground that it is under the management of a minority,
                            whether based on religion or language.”
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Article 29, “Protection of interests of minorities”, says:
                    <ul>
                        <li>“(1) Any section of the citizens residing in the territory of India or any part thereof
                            having a distinct language, script or culture of its own shall have the right to conserve
                            the same.”
                        </li>
                        <li>But isn’t there a conflict between the fundamental principle of equality and the special
                            rights conferred on these groups by the Constitution?
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Article 30(1) could seem to be in contradiction to Article 29(2), which says, “No citizen shall be
                    denied admission into any educational institution maintained by the State or receiving aid out of
                    State funds on grounds only of religion, race, caste, language or any of them.”
                </li>
                <li>Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), also has been in the courts for decades over the same issue.</li>
                <li>The university contends that it was set up by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan principally for minority uplift,
                    and therefore, it has to be seen to have a minority personality.
                </li>
                <li>JMI, ironically, was created almost as the anti-thesis to Aligarh, when a group of scholars “walked
                    out” of the AMU campus to set up Jamia in Delhi in the nationalist tradition, under Mahatma Gandhi’s
                    influence and patronage.

                        the brain.
                    </li>
                    <li>Meaning of Acute: when a disease appears abruptly and grows at a fast pace.</li>
                    <li>A person afflicted with encephalitis requires serious medical attention.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>What are the causes of encephalitis?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The disease can occur in people of all ages, but children and the elderly are more at risk of
                        being afflicted with the disease.
                    </li>
                    <li>The usual cause of the rare disease is either a viral infection.</li>
                    <li>Sometimes it is caused when the brain’s own immune system mistakenly attacks brain tissue.</li>
                    <li>In rare cases, encephalitis is caused due to bacterial infection, parasites, or may be prompted
                        from other infectious diseases.
                    </li>
                    <li>It is a non-communicable disease.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>What is Japanese encephalitis?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>One of the most common form of viral encephalitis in Asia is the Japanese encephalitis virus
                        (JEV), caused by mosquito-borne flavivirus.
                    </li>
                    <li>The disease belongs to the same genus as dengue, yellow and West Nile viruses.</li>
                    <li>JEV primarily affects children as most adults tend to attain natural immunity from the disease,
                        according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>How can the disease be prevented?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are several vaccinations that are effective in preventing the disease, including vaccines
                        for measles, mumps, and rubella.
                    </li>
                    <li>People should also use proper clothing to prevent being bitten by mosquitoes in
                        mosquito-infested areas.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Is the disease prevalent in India? How severe is it?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Japanese Encephalitis is recognised as the leading cause of the disease in India.</li>
                    <li>Region affected: West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Manipur, Andhra Pradesh, Goa,
                        Pondicherry and Karnataka.
                    </li>
                    <li>Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are two states, which have seen the most number of encephalitis cases in
                        recent years.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Uttar Pradesh government in May this year launched a vaccination campaign in 38 sensitive
                        districts of the state to combat the JE virus.<strong/></li>

            <li>After prolonged diplomatic negotiations, India and China finally agreed to disengage from the standoff

        <ul>
            <li>The pronouncements by India and China that the Doklam military stand-off has come to an end signifies a
                comfortable sign over the diplomacy that prevailed over the harsh rhetoric of the past.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Key Points</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The “expeditious disengagement of border personnel” shows the India’s policy of pursuing diplomatic
                measures in the face of China’s heated rhetoric was prudent.
            </li>
            <li>Both New Delhi and Beijing have appreciated the aspirations of the Bhutanese government, which sought an
                immediate end to the crisis before the bitter winter set in.
            </li>
            <li>Chinese proclamations during the stand-off signify that it no longer appreciates the advances made in
                the Special Representative talks in 2012.
            </li>
            <li>China does not respect the India-Bhutan-China tri-junction near Batang-La to have been stable.</li>
            <li>India also made it clear that it does not believe that the Sikkim boundary is settled either.</li>
            <li>Both the countries should take a step back to the essence of the Border Defence Cooperation Agreement of
                2013 and the specific guidelines laid down on handling any future developments along the 3,488-km
                boundary the two countries.

        <p><strong>Context</strong><strong> </strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>As the Iraqi war of 1991 began to descend, the spirit of history positioned the son of a small village
                near Azamgarh at the helm of the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi.
            </li>
            <li>The big new idea was called “strategic defiance”. When the United States turn inevitable, Pakistan would
                lead a battle on mid-sized powers like Iraq and Iran, helped by China.
            </li>
            <li>Presently President Donald Trump’s new South Asia doctrine is frightening Pakistan with severe effects.
                Henceforth should it fail to turn on its jihadist proxies, has made strategic defiance relevant again.
            </li>
            <li>The pillars of the new South Asia strategy:
                <ol>
                    <li>Open-ended guarantee to the Afghan war with the use of all the instruments of American power,
                    </li>
                    <li>A greater role for New Delhi and strategic partnership with India</li>
                    <li>Annihilating terror safe-havens in Pakistan to destroy jihadism, and with it, growing Iranian,
                        Chinese and Russian influence.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>General Pervez Musharraf was communicated that Pakistan would be bombed “back into the stone age” if the
                country did not desert its al Qaeda and Taliban proxies.
            </li>
            <li>Past records depict that each time the United States has slashed aid to Pakistan, geopolitical
                coincidence compelled it to reverse course.
            </li>
            <li>Aid dropped to near-zero levels after Pakistan’s nuclear-weapons programme in 1980.</li>
            <li>The 1990s saw a sharp reduction in aid after the anti-Soviet jihad ended and President George Bush
                refused to certify Pakistan did not possess nuclear weapons. Then, it surged after 9/11, rising to
                historic levels of $4.5 billion in 2010.
            </li>
            <li>The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimates that over 68 per cent of Pakistan’s arms
                imports in 2012-2016 came from China.
            </li>
            <li>The United States has the capacity to target jihadist infrastructure and individuals deep inside
                Pakistan to unleash its Afghan allies’ covert assets to execute retaliatory terrorism in Pakistan.
            </li>
            <li>The end state of the Afghan war involves degrading the jihadist movement, not just a defined group of
                terrorists, thus denying space for great-power competitors to assert influence in a
                strategically-important region.
            </li>
            <li>Strategic defiance shows the defensive game well.</li>
            <li>Trump must beware the fact that a foul or two can go a long way in leveling the odds against superior
                opposition.

        <p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The government should reform labour laws and make them more flexible to make it easier to do business in
                the country.
            </li>
            <li>More enterprises in labour-intensive sectors reported that finding skilled workers, hiring contract
                labour and terminating employees was a major or a severe obstacle.
            </li>
            <li>Pitched for accelerating power sector reforms to ensure that power-intensive enterprises have access to
                steady and uninterrupted power without undue delays or regulatory burden.
            </li>
            <li>Half of the enterprises do not borrow from financial institutions and about a third consider lack of
                access to finance as a major source of obstacles for business in the country
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>More flexible labour laws will allow enterprises to grow larger and reap economies of scale, generating
                productivity improvements, jobs creation and higher growth.
            </li>
            <li>If India is to enter the ‘double digit’ economic growth club, it will need to continually streamline and
                improve the business environment.

        <p><strong>In news:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Ministry of <strong>New &amp; Renewable Energy (MNRE</strong>) had issued the new guidelines for
                tariff based competitive bidding process for procuring solar power
            </li>
            <li>The guidelines have been issued under the provisions of Section 63 of the Electricity Act, 2003 for long
                term procurement from grid-connected Solar PV Power Projects of 5 MW and above, through competitive
                bidding.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Salient features of the guidelines issued</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Generation compensation for offtake constraints for reducing offtake risks</li>
            <li>The ‘must-run’ status for solar projects has been stressed upon.</li>
            <li>Besides, to ensure lower tariffs, minimum PPA (power purchase agreement) tenure has been kept at 25
                years. Moreover unilateral termination or amendment of PPA is not allowed.
            </li>
            <li>Provides for termination compensation to increase bankability of projects by securing the investment by
                the generator and the lenders against any arbitrary termination of PPA.
            </li>
            <li>The risk of generator’s revenue getting blocked due to delayed payment/non-payment by the procurers has
                been addressed through provision of Payment Security Mechanism through instruments like Letter of Credit
                (LC), Payment Security Fund and State Guarantee.
            </li>
            <li>It also provides for change in law provision to provide clarity and certainty to generators, procurers,
                and investors/lenders.
            </li>
            <li>The penalties have been rationalised so as to reduce the overall cost to the generator, while at the
                same time, ensuring compliance with the Commissioning Schedule/Scheme Guidelines.
            </li>
            <li>The norms provide that generators are free to repower their plants.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Significance of this move</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>New Guidelines for Tariff Based Competitive Bidding Process to reduce risk, enhance transparency and
                increase affordability of Solar Power
            </li>
            <li>It will also provide standardisation and uniformity in processes and a risk-sharing framework between
                various stakeholders involved in the solar PV power procurement

    </p>
    <div id="Forex">
        <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>India’s forex reserve is reaching the $400 billion mark on the back of a stronger rupee against the US
                dollar.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>In 2013, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was struggling to save the rupee from a free fall and was
                compelled to raise emergency foreign currency deposits from non-resident Indians.
            </li>
            <li>Today’s concerns are with respect to appreciating currency and the problems the central bank is facing
                in managing the strong rupee.
            </li>
            <li>Strong foreign inflows contributed to a rise by over $23 billion so far in the current financial year.
            </li>
            <li>A recent report by Edelweiss Securities Ltd stated that continuous interference by the RBI brought India
                close to getting in the currency maneuvering watch list of the US.
            </li>
            <li>The accommodative monetary policy in the developed world and the global financial system is flush with
                cheap money and investors are in a desperate search for yield.
            </li>
            <li>For example, $1 billion worth of bonds issued by the government of Iraq were oversubscribed and sold at
                a lower than expected yield.
            </li>
            <li>Rupee has been appreciated by about 6% since the beginning of this year, despite persistent intervention
                by the RBI
            </li>
            <li>Non-intervention or insufficient intervention would result in further appreciation of the rupee and
                affect India’s competitiveness.
            </li>
            <li>The external competitiveness is not exclusively dependent on the exchange rate. Therefore, there is no
                harm in suppressing volatility if possible, and giving businesses a more stable economic environment.
            </li>
            <li>The present liquidity situation is making things more difficult for the RBI.</li>
            <li>The banking system has excess liquidity of around Rs3 trillion and currency market intervention will
                increase this.
            </li>
            <li>Even though there is no imminent threat of high inflation, persistent surplus liquidity can affect
                monetary policy operations.
            </li>
            <li>The yields on foreign assets are much lower than government bonds and sterilized intervention is in
                effect a switch in central bank holdings from rupee to dollar securities.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>So how can the central bank deal with this problem of plenty?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Work on government instrument like market stabilization scheme bonds and continue to build reserves.
            </li>
            <li>But, the cost would keep rising, as higher reserves would attract more flows, which will reduce the
                currency risk for foreign investors.
            </li>
            <li>The other option is to reassesses the kind of foreign funds it wants.</li>
            <li>India’s external debt is at about 20% of gross domestic product, and about 37% of this is commercial
                borrowing.
            </li>
            <li>Policy rationalization on this front can ease the pressure on both the RBI and the rupee.</li>

                        cyclones (TC) noticed in the Western Pacific.

                    <li>Typically August will be the second most bountiful monsoon month after July.</li>
                    <li><strong>Process:</strong></li>

                        westwards towards India and aid rain-bearing systems over the sub-continent.

                        push to the rains as they do in the good monsoon years.

                    <li><strong>What is El Nino?</strong> El Nino years are those when sea surface temperatures in the
                        east equatorial Pacific rise, and often dampen the monsoon.

                        <li>Shahari Rozgar Yojana (SJSRY) The main reason is that urban poor have a strong desire to

            </ul>
            <p><strong>Clearing out of Long Pending Cases</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lower courts in Kerala, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, and Chandigarh have disposed of almost
                    all cases that had been pending for a decade or more
                </li>
                <li><strong>Key Fact:</strong></li>
                <li>A total of 11,000 cases pending for over 10 years in these four states and the Union territory of
                    Chandigarh
                </li>
                <li>National pendency count is at around 2.3 million cases</li>
                <li>Delhi, Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Karnataka are also close to clearing out
                    long-pending cases
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Lessons to be learnt from lower Courts:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The high court of Punjab and Haryana has jurisdiction over the lower courts of Punjab, Haryana and
                    Chandigarh
                </li>
                <li><strong>Case management system</strong>—i.e. a mechanism to monitor every case from filing to
                    disposal, setup a decade ago.
                </li>
                <li>It also began to categorize writ petitions based on their urgency</li>
                <li>In addition, it set annual targets and action plans for judicial officers to dispose of old cases.
                </li>
                <li>And began a <strong>quarterly performance review</strong> to ensure that cases were not disposed of
                    with undue haste
                </li>
                <li>All these measures ushered in a degree <strong>of transparency and accountability</strong> in the
                    system, the results of which are now apparent
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Judicial Case Management:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>In this system, the court sets a timetable for the case and the judge actively monitors progress
                </li>
                <li>This marks a fundamental shift in the management of cases—the responsibility for which moves from
                    the litigants and their lawyers to the court
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Law Commission of India’s Report suggestions :</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Law Commission of India in its 230th report has also offered a long list of measures to deal
                    with the pendency of cases
                </li>
                <li>These include</li>
            </ul>
            <p>(1) Providing strict guidelines for the grant of adjournments</p>
            <p>(2) Curtailing vacation time in the higher judiciary</p>
            <p>(3) Reducing the time for oral arguments unless the case involves a complicated question of law</p>
            <p>(4) And framing clear and decisive judgements to avoid further litigation</p>
            <p><strong>Way Forwards:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The courts should also seriously consider incorporating technology into the system</li>
                <li>Digitizing courts records has been a good start in this context</li>
                <li>Just like automation powered by Artificial Intelligence is already helping doctors, it can also be
                    leveraged to assist judges and lawyers

                <li><strong>Supreme Court directive: </strong></li>
                <li>Directed the Chief Justices of all High Courts to <strong>suo motu</strong> register petitions to

                    compensation.
                </li>
                <li>This judgment is significant as the high court will now directly award compensation and ensure

                </li>
                <li>However, compliance by State governments is low as these commissions do not exercise any power of

            <ul>
                <li>Even though the Doklam issue is resolved, it can happen again on the long unsettled border between
                    the two countries, at a place and time of China’s choosing.
                </li>

                        </li>
                        <li>A strong patent system and robust IPRs environment is required to encourage research and to

                            <li>The widening of the CAD on a year-on-year basis was primarily on account of a higher
                                <strong>trade deficit</strong> ($41.2 billion) brought about by a <strong>larger

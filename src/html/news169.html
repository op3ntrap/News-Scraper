                        this International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development, with community events such
                        as guided night walks, live music gigs, a beauty pageant, and stalls showcasing
                        the cuisine, wine, arts and craft of the region.

                    <li>Cherry Blossom Festivals celebrated in countries like Japan, USA, Switzerland, and Korea have
                        established an “intercontinental friendship”, and voiced hope that in a few years, Meghalaya can
                        get international recognition with the active participation of government departments and
                        stakeholders.
                    </li>
                    <li>The first cherry blossom festival in Shillong was held in 2016 but this year, the Meghalaya
                        government decided to make it an international event this year.
                    </li>
                    <li>The festival is being organised by the Meghalaya government in collaboration with the Institute
                        of Bioresources and Sustainable Development (IBSD), a national institute under the Department of
                        Biotechnology, and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR).

                        Janaagraha.
                    </li>
                    <li>The objective of the program is to address neighborhood safety and security concerns through
                        responsible participation of the citizenry in crime prevention, at the level of the local
                        community. Here both police and citizens work in partnership to ensure a safer and secure
                        neighbourhood.
                    </li>
                    <li>Community Policing focuses on community engagement to address issues of crime and social
                        disorder through the delivery of police services, which include aspects of traditional law
                        enforcement, prevention and solving the safety and security challenges.
                    </li>
                    <li>It is an approach, wherein community support and interaction helps prevent &amp; control crime
                        and citizens have a say in identifying and solving neighborhood safety and security concerns. CP
                        accomplishes this through harnessing participation from active <strong>citizen volunteers, also
                            called as Area Suraksha Mitras (ASMs</strong><strong>)</strong>.

                        world’s ‘hottest hotspots’ of biological diversity.
                    </li>
                    <li>The new species was found in the Periyar Tiger Reserve.</li>
                    <li>Belonging to <strong>Tyrannomyrmex</strong>, a rare tropical genus of ants, the species was
                        discovered by the team from the Vallakadavu range
                    </li>
                    <li>Paying tribute to their mentor and eminent myrmecologist Musthak Ali, who is regarded as the
                        country’s ‘ant man’, the authors of the study have named the new species Tyrannomyrmex alii (or
                        T. alii) Sadasivan and Kripakaran 2017.
                    </li>
                    <li>Tyrannomyrmex is a rare myrmicine (subfamily of ants) ant genus that is distributed in the
                        Indomalayan bio-region that extends from southern India and Sri Lanka to southeast Asia.

                <p><strong><em><u>Where is it found?</u></em></strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The particular genus had been erected in 2003 with the discovery of the species, <strong>Tyrannomyrmex
                        rex Fernández, in Pasoh Forest Reserve</strong>, Malaysia.
                    </li>
                    <li>Later, two more species that were under the same genus had been discovered; <strong>Tyrannomyrmex
                        dux (or T. dux)</strong> from the Ponmudi hills in 2007 and <strong> legatus</strong> from the
                        Sinharaja Forest Reserve in Sri Lanka in 2013.
                    </li>
                    <li>alli has thus become the four species of the rare genus and the second one from India. Notably,
                        both of the Tyrannomyrmex species that have been described from the country are known from the
                        Western Ghats range in Kerala.

                <ul>
                    <li>The new species can be distinguished from the <strong>other species of the same genus through
                        its morphological characteristics.</strong></li>
                    <li>While it differed from <strong><em> T. dux </em>by the petiolar shape</strong>, it became
                        <strong>dissimilar to <em>T. legatus</em> and <em>T. rex </em>by surface sculpture and pilosity</strong>.

                    </li>
                    <li>It is notable as an elephant reserve and a tiger reserve.</li>
                    <li>The park is a repository of rare, endemic and endangered flora and fauna and forms the major
                        watershed of two important rivers of Kerala, the Periyar and the Pamba.
                    </li>
                    <li>The park is often called the Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary or Thekkady. It is located high in the

                    </li>
                    <li>The first official action towards the conservation of wildlife and biodiversity in Kerala was
                        taken in 1934 by the Maharaja of Travancore, Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma, by declaring the
                        forests around Periyar lake as a private game reserve to stop the encroachment of tea

                    <li>As air pollution hit alarming levels in Delhi, major city hospitals on November 8 experienced a
                        surge in the number of patients complaining of respiratory problems with the AIIMS chief
                        comparing the situation to the killer Great Smog of London in 1952.

                <ul>
                    <li>The Great Smog of London, or Great Smog of 1952 sometimes called the Big Smoke, was a severe
                        air-pollution event that affected the British capital of London in December 1952.
                    </li>
                    <li>A period of <strong>cold weather, combined with an anticyclone and windless conditions</strong>,
                        collected airborne pollutants – mostly arising from the use of coal – to form a thick layer of
                        smog over the city.
                    </li>
                    <li>It lasted from 5 December to 9 December 1952 and then dispersed quickly when the weather
                        changed.

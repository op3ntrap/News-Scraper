                    <p><strong>AEOI</strong>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The new global standard on Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) reduces the possibility
                            for tax evasion. It provides for the exchange of non-resident financial account information
                            with the tax authorities in the account holders’ country of residence. Participating
                            jurisdictions that implement AEOI send and receive pre-agreed information each year, without
                            having to send a specific request.

                        <li>AEOI will enable the discovery of formerly undetected tax evasion. It will enable
                            governments to recover tax revenue lost to non-compliant taxpayers, and will further
                            strengthen international efforts to increase transparency, cooperation, and accountability
                            among financial institutions and tax administrations. Additionally, AEOI will generate
                            secondary benefits by increasing voluntary disclosures of concealed assets and by
                            encouraging taxpayers to report all relevant information.

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Zika virus</strong> is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that was first identified in
                            Uganda in 1947 in monkeys through a network that monitored yellow fever.
                        </li>
                        <li>It was later identified in humans in 1952 in Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania.

                            clear, but is likely to be a few days. The symptoms are similar to other arbovirus
                            infections such as dengue, and include fever, skin rashes, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint
                            pain, malaise, and headache. These symptoms are usually mild and last for 2-7 days.

                        <li>Based on a systematic review of the literature up to 30 May 2016, WHO has concluded that
                            Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of congenital brain abnormalities,
                            including microcephaly; and that Zika virus is a trigger of Guillain-Barré syndrome. Intense
                            efforts are continuing to investigate the link between Zika virus and a range of
                            neurological disorders, within a rigorous research framework.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Zika virus is primarily transmitted to people through the bite of an infected mosquito from
                            the Aedes genus, mainly Aedes aegypti in tropical regions. Aedes mosquitoes usually bite
                            during the day, peaking during early morning and late afternoon/evening. This is the same
                            mosquito that transmits dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever. Sexual transmission of Zika

                        <ul>
                            <li>Stanford University scientists have found that using blue-green algae and light to
                                trigger photosynthesis inside the heart could help treat cardiac disease, the top cause
                                of death globally.
                            </li>
                            <li>Researchers injected a type of bacteria into the hearts of anaesthetised rats with
                                cardiac disease. Using light to trigger photosynthesis, they were able to increase the
                                flow of oxygen and improve heart function.
                            </li>
                            <li>In nature, humans exhale carbon dioxide and plants convert it back to oxygen. During a
                                heart attack, the muscle is still trying to pump. There’s carbon dioxide but no oxygen.

                        <ul>
                            <li>Myocardial ischemia occurs when blood flow to your heart is reduced, preventing it from
                                receiving enough oxygen. The reduced blood flow is usually the result of a partial or
                                complete blockage of your heart’s arteries.
                            </li>
                            <li>The researchers plan to investigate how to apply this concept to humans and how to
                                deliver a light source to the human heart. They are also examining the potential of
                                using artificial chloroplasts to eliminate the need for bacteria.

                                    <p>The Union Health Ministry has launched an Intensified Diarrhea Control Fortnight
                                        (IDCF) across the country to reduce child deaths due to diarrhoea. Through this
                                        initiative, the Ministry will mobilize health personnel, State Governments and
                                        other stakeholders in controlling the disease, which is one of the most common
                                        childhood illnesses. During the IDCF, the awareness campaign on hygiene and
                                        promotion of ORS and Zinc therapy will be conducted at state, district and
                                        village levels. Nearly 12 crore under five children will be covered during the
                                        programme. As per an estimate, 1.1 million children die every year in India out
                                        of which about one lakh death occur due to this disease. Diarrhoea can be
                                        prevented with safe drinking water, sanitation, breastfeeding and appropriate
                                        nutrition.</p></div>

                                    <p>India has topped the global remittance-receiving list of 2016, as per the latest
                                        United Nations report ‘One Family at a Time’. As per the report, Indians working
                                        across the globe sent home $62.7 billion US dollars in 2016, followed by China
                                        ($61 billion), Philippines ($30 billion) and Pakistan ($20 billion). The ‘One
                                        Family at a Time’ study by the UN International Fund for Agricultural
                                        Development (IFAD) stated that about 200 million migrants globally sent more
                                        than $445 billion dollars as remittances in 2016 to their families. Remittance
                                        flows have grown over the last decade from $296 billion in 2007 to $445 billion
                                        in 2016. It has risen at a rate averaging 4.2 per cent annually. The study is
                                        the first-ever of a 10-year trend in migration and remittance flows over the
                                        period 2007-2016. The report has made several recommendations for improving
                                        public policies and outlines proposals for partnerships with the private sector
                                        to reduce costs and create opportunities for migrants and their families to use
                                        their money more productively.</p></div>

            <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Recommendations of the expert committee constituted by the centre after the Supreme Court struck
                    down the controversial section <strong>66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Committee:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The committee was headed by former Law Secretary T K Vishwanathan.</li>
                <li>The report was submitted to the Union Home Ministry.</li>
                <li><strong>Mandate:</strong> Study domestic and international cyber laws and propose a legal framework
                    in order to deal with online hate speech and incitement of violence
                </li>
                <li><strong>Recommendations:</strong> The Indian Penal Code, Criminal Procedure Code and the Information
                    Technology Act should be amended to include stringent provisions
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p> <strong>Recommendations of the committee:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>No need to re-introduce Section 66A but strengthen IPC instead.</li>
                <li>Indian Penal Code, 1860; Prohibiting incitement to hatred: Amend IPC section 153 C to include in
                    communication “spoken or written words, signs, visible representation, information, audio, video, or
                    combination of both, transmitted, retransmitted through any telecommunication service, communication
                    device or computer resource”.<br/> <strong>Punishment:</strong> up to 2 years or fine of Rs 5000 or
                    both.
                </li>
                <li>Causing fear alarm or provocation of violence in certain cases: Amend IPC section 505A, punishment
                    of any person or group of persons who intentionally, on grounds of religion, race, caste or
                    community, gender, sexual orientation, place of birth, residence, language, disability or tribe,
                    uses any means of communication to communicate.<br/> <strong>Punishment: </strong>up to 1 year or
                    fine of Rs 5000 or both.
                </li>
                <li>Amendment in Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: create a post of State Cyber-Crime Coordinator (not
                    below rank of Inspector General of Police) and District Cyber-Crime Cell
                </li>
                <li>Amending the Information Technology Act, 2000: Amending section 78 allows a police officer not below
                    the rank of Sub-Inspector to investigate any offence under this Act as young SIs are better equipped
                    and trained in dealing with these crimes.
                </li>
                <li>A renovated section 66A has not been recommended in the IT Act, 2000. This is because the IT Act is
                    basically commercial in nature and hence punishments have been recommended in the IPC.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Important observations:</strong> In recommending specific changes the committee said
                    <ol>
                        <li>Only that speech should be accounted as relevant which relates to “religion, race, caste,
                            community, sex, gender, place of birth, residence and language.”
                        </li>
                        <li>Online speech would be criminalised “only both, when it advocates hatred and causes the
                            incitement of an offence”.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Way forward:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Section 66A was struck down as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court on the ground that it violated
                    the basic freedom of expression of the citizens. There is need to balance the liberty of citizens
                    while tackling the issues of hate speech, online harassment-hatred and national security.
                </li>
                <li>The real purpose of the committee would be served only when the Parliament takes actions on these
                    recommendations by keeping in mind the spirit of the 2015 Supreme Court judgement.

        <div id="Doklam hangover? China deploys almost 1,000 PLA troops at standoff site, indicates tension not over yet">
            <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>More than five weeks after India and China stepped back from a standoff at Doklam on the Sikkim
                    border, Indian soldiers remain on high alert with around 1,000 Chinese troops still present on the
                    plateau, a few hundred metres from the faceoff site,.
                </li>
                <li>But, India does not expect another “flashpoint” at the same site between the two countries.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The presence of People’s Liberation Army (PLA) was also acknowledged by Air Chief Marshal B S Dhanoa
                    recently and it has subsequently thinned in the area after the process of “disengagement” began but
                    one PLA battalion remains on the plateau.
                </li>
                <li>The deployment is expected to be reduced by two-thirds to brigade-level in the coming weeks.</li>
                <li>The Chinese have not dismantled any of their tents, temporary construction in the vicinity and they
                    still have road construction equipment and other stores.
                </li>
                <li>But everything is under surveillance by the Indian Army.</li>
                <li>Indian soldiers returned to their posts at Doka La but their numbers have since been strengthened.
                </li>
                <li>The tracks leading to Doka La were improved during the faceoff, leading to enhanced logistics supply
                    lines.
                </li>
                <li>Road construction equipment, such as bulldozers and JCBs, have also been kept on location.</li>

            <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The SEBI panel on corporate governance led by Uday Kotak has proposed some important changes</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>In news:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>These changes include splitting the posts of chairman and managing director and amending rules on
                    independent directors, disclosures, and accounting and auditing practices
                </li>
                <li>Currently, of the 50 companies on the benchmark Nifty, at least 12, including Reliance Industries,
                    ONGC and Wipro, have the same person occupying both posts
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Date of implementation: </strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Listed companies with more than 40% public shareholding should separate the roles of chairperson and
                    MD or CEO from April 1, 2020
                </li>
                <li>SEBI may consider extending the requirement to all listed entities by April 1, 2022</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Concerns expressed:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Some experts said splitting the two roles shouldn’t be made a legal requirement</li>
                <li><strong>Reason:</strong> Splitting of CMD role would mean two power centres instead of one but if
                    enforced into a law, the chairman can just appoint a person who agrees with them as MD
                </li>
                <li>According to some experts, such a thing cannot be forced and should be recommended as best practice
                    rather than be made into a legal provision
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Other recommendations:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The panel has also made several recommendations to strengthen the role of directors</li>
                <li>Companies would need to induct at least six directors, up from the current minimum of three under
                    the <strong>Companies Act</strong>, with at least one <strong>independent woman director</strong>
                </li>
                <li>The panel has also recommended increasing the number of board meetings held every year</li>
                <li>And an age limit for non-executive directors and capped the number of directorships that an
                    individual can hold
                </li>

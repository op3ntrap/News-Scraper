                <li>The Supreme Court’s judgment on the constitutionality of triple talaq may also decide the age-old
                    debate whether <strong>personal laws</strong> can be brought under the ambit of <strong>Article
                        13</strong> (laws inconsistent with or in derogation of the fundamental rights) of the

                    have jurisdiction to strike down provisions of personal law.

                <li>Organisations calling for reform and Muslim women from various walks of life across the country have
                    urged the court to declare triple talaq and polygamy as “un-Islamic”.

                <li>A judicial declaration from a Constitution Bench under Article 13 that personal laws are liable to
                    comply with the fundamental rights guaranteed by Constitution would bring religious law, even
                    uncodified practices, under judicial review.

            <p><strong>Discussions on “different systems of elections”</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>An all-party Parliamentary panel is exploring “different systems of elections”, other than the
                    first-past-the-post (FPTP) system
                </li>
                <li>FPTP is currently followed in the Lok Sabha and Assembly polls</li>
                <li>The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice, has sent a
                    six-page “Questionnaire on Electoral Reforms” to all parties and the Election Commission
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What is ‘First Past the Post’ system?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A first-past-the-post (abbreviated as FPTP, 1stP, 1PTP or FPP) voting method is one in which voters
                    indicate on a ballot the candidate of their choice, and the candidate who receives most votes wins
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>First-past-the-post voting is one of several plurality voting methods</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is a common, but not universal, feature of electoral systems with single-member electoral
                    divisions; in fact, first-past-the-post voting is widely practiced in close to one third of the
                    world’s countries
                </li>
                <li>Some notable examples include the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, India and most of the
                    colonies and protectorates either currently or formerly belonging to these countries
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why is the PSC exploring different systems of elections?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>According the PSC, in recent years the FPTP system is not the best suited system as is evident from
                    the recent Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh
                </li>
                <li>Many Opposition leaders have reminded the BJP that it won the 2014 Lok Sabha polls because of the
                    FPTP system
                </li>
                <li>As the party polled only about 31 per cent of the vote share</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Other issues discussed by the panel</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The views of parties and the EC have been sought under five heads: (1) ‘Electoral Funding’, (2)
                    ‘Systems of Elections’, (3) ‘Media/ Free Airtime’, (4) ‘Internal Democracy in Political Parties’,
                    and (5) ‘Miscellaneous’
                </li>
                <li>On the issue of electoral funding, the panel has sought views on the electoral bonds and on the
                    proposal regarding state funding of elections

                            sense, it refers only to the line of control in the western sector of the borderland between
                            the two countries. In that sense, the LAC forms the effective border between the two
                            countries together with the (also disputed) McMahon Line in the east, and a small undisputed
                            section in between. In the wider sense, it can be used to refer to both the western line of
                            control and the MacMahon Line, in which sense it is the effective border between India and
                            the People’s Republic of China (PRC)
                        </li>
                        <li>The demarcation existed as the informal cease-fire line between India and China after the
                            1962 conflict until 1993, when its existence was officially accepted as the ‘Line of Actual
                            Control’ in a bilateral agreement.

                        <p><strong>Corporate governance </strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Corporate governance is the system of rules, practices and processes by which a company
                                is directed and controlled.
                            </li>
                            <li>Corporate governance essentially involves balancing the interests of a company’s many
                                stakeholders, such as shareholders, management, customers, suppliers, financiers,
                                government and the community.
                            </li>
                            <li>Since corporate governance also provides the framework for attaining a company’s
                                objectives, it encompasses practically every sphere of management, from action plans and
                                internal controls to performance measurement and corporate disclosure.

                <ul>
                    <li>The impact of caste in economic mobility in India</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Indian society</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The caste system is the most distinctive feature of Indian society.</li>
                    <li>The Indian population is divided into four hierarchical classes, or varnas, with a large
                        sub-population of untouchables excluded entirely from the system.
                    </li>
                    <li>Within each of these classes, and among the untouchables, are thousands of castes, or jatis.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>How caste system supports occupational and spatial mobility?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The exploitation, prejudice, and discrimination that are associated with the hierarchical aspect
                        of the caste system have stifled mobility among the lower castes.
                    </li>
                    <li>Lower castes remained locked in unskilled, low-paying occupations for centuries in the
                        traditional economy.
                    </li>
                    <li>There is also evidence of continuing discrimination in the labour market</li>
                    <li>Convergence between upper and lower castes in education and jobs</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Reasons</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Affirmative action policy :</strong> It has been in place since Independence, reserving
                        seats in institutions of higher education and the central government for former untouchables and
                        other disadvantaged groups
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Caste-based networks:</strong> It facilitate economic activity and support the mobility
                        of their members in an economy where markets function imperfectly.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Particular castes :</strong> They found particular niches in the urban labour market,
                        and once networks in the city were established, they supported the movement of fresh migrants
                        from the hinterland
                    </li>
                    <li>Structural change has created new economic opportunities over the past 25 years</li>
                    <li>There is a movement of castes from agriculture and administrative occupations into business in
                        recent decades.
                    </li>
                    <li>Once caste networks form, they will strengthen relatively rapidly in historically disadvantaged
                        castes.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Caste networks can also be a hindrance to mobility? How</strong>? The same networks that can
                    be so effective in supporting the movement of groups of individuals across space and occupations can
                    also restrict the mobility of individual members once they are established</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Schooling choice is a strong predictor of future occupations.</li>
                    <li>Particular castes historically occupied niches in Mumbai’s mills and factories with the support
                        of their networks.
                    </li>
                    <li>When the Indian economy restructured in the early 1990s, shifted economic activity in Mumbai
                        from manufacturing to services
                    </li>
                    <li>But in the schooling choices of the children, that these blue-collar networks turned out to be a
                        hindrance in this economy, keeping their members in the traditional (now less remunerative)
                        occupations and preventing them from taking advantage of the new opportunities that became
                        available.
                    </li>
                    <li>Rural mutual insurance networks, which have smoothed consumption within castes for centuries,
                        can restrict the migration of individual members to the city.
                    </li>
                    <li>When a household suffers a negative income shock, it receives monetary transfers from caste
                        members
                    </li>
                    <li>In the future, it is expected to provide transfers to other households when they receive a
                        negative shock. But a household with migrants will be less insured by its rural network
                    </li>
                    <li>The restriction on mobility which leads to inefficiency in the labour market, arises because
                        formal substitutes for the rural insurance network, such as private credit or government safety
                        nets, are unavailable
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Community based networks-Features</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is active in all developing countries where markets are functioning imperfectly.</li>
                    <li>These networks are exceptional with respect to their size and scope in India, because of the
                        special caste-based structure of its society.
                    </li>
                    <li>Caste networks thus play an unusually important role in shaping economic mobility in the Indian
                        economy
                    </li>
                    <li>Whether these networks support or hinder mobility will depend on the circumstances</li>
                    <li>Networks are effective in supporting the movement of groups, but they can restrict the mobility
                        of individuals trying to follow a path of their own.
                    </li>
                    <li>The caste networks will disappear when the market economy starts to function efficiently.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Way forward</strong></p>
                <p>Policies aimed at fostering growth would be more effective if they took account of the underlying
                    caste networks that continue to shape educational, occupational, and locational choices in the
                    Indian economy.</p>

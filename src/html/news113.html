                <li>Women and Child Development ministry is planning to revamp of its supplementary nutrition
                    programme.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Direct to beneficiaries:</strong> States should provide nutrient packages directly to
                    beneficiaries instead of providing food through anganwadis.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Present scenario:</strong> the supplementary nutrition is in the form of take-home rations
                    or hot-cooked meals
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>New Policy:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Under the new policy, instead of food, the focus would be on nutrient packets that will provide
                    1,000 calories to pregnant and lactating mothers and 600 calories to children
                </li>
                <li>The packets(mentioned above) would have a dry mixture of peanuts, millets and micro-nutrients which
                    can be consumed with milk, lassi, juice, or water
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Ministry’s suggestion:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Nutrient packages should be delivered through post offices</li>
                <li>Thirty packages can be delivered through the post office to every family that has a baby and a
                    pregnant mother. Since it is not vegetable or rice, it cannot be misused or sold in the market

            <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sub-categorization of the Other Backward Classes (OBC)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Creation of committee</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Recently, the government has announced the creation of a committee to look into sub-categorisation
                    of OBC
                </li>
                <li>This decision provides an opening to ensure social justice in an efficient manner</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key Stats:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The National Sample Survey (NSS) data from 2011-12 show that about 19% of the sample claims to be
                    Dalit, 9% Adivasi, and 44% OBC
                </li>
                <li>Among the population aged 25-49, less than 7% have a college degree</li>
                <li>By most estimates, less than 3% of the whole population is employed in government and public-sector
                    jobs
                </li>
                <li>Since reservations cover only half the college seats and public-sector jobs, the mismatch is
                    obvious
                </li>
                <li>A vast proportion of the population eligible for reservations must still compete for a tiny number
                    of reserved and non-reserved category jobs
                </li>
                <li>It is not surprising that there is tremendous internal competition within groups</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Yardstick to determine marginalization within a particular caste:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>At the moment, the only reputable nationwide data on caste comes from the 1931 colonial Census and
                    some of the ad hoc surveys conducted for specific castes
                </li>
                <li>The Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) of 2011 was supposed to provide up-to-date comprehensive
                    data
                </li>
                <li>In the SECC in 2015, it was found that about 4.6 million distinct caste names, including names of
                    gotra, surname and phonetic variations were returned, making the results almost impossible to
                    interpret
                </li>
                <li>For nearly 80 million individuals, caste data were believed to be erroneous</li>
                <li>Since then we have heard little about the quality of caste data in SECC and even less about its
                    results
                </li>
                <li>Preparations for Census 2021 are ongoing</li>
                <li>There is still time to create an expert group to evaluate the methodology for collecting caste data
                    and include it in the Census forms
                </li>
                <li>Losing this opportunity would leave us hanging for another 10 years without good data for
                    undertaking sub-categorisation of OBC quota
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Addressing caste based inequalities:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A two-pronged approach that focusses on eliminating discrimination and expanding the proportion of
                    population among the disadvantaged groups could be a solution
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>(1) Late Benefits</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The present policies focus on preferential admission to colleges and coveted institutions like IITs
                    and IIMs
                </li>
                <li>But these benefits may come too late in the life of a Kurmi or Gujjar child</li>
                <li>Their disadvantage begins in early childhood and grows progressively at higher levels of education
                </li>
                <li>We know little about what goes on in schools to create these disadvantages but improving quality of
                    education for all must be a first step in addressing caste-based inequalities
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>(2) Benefits of reservations should be widely spread</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use of the OBC quota must be limited to once in a person’s lifetime, allowing for a churn in the
                    population benefitting from reservations
                </li>
                <li>Linking the Aadhaar card to use of benefits makes it possible that individuals use their caste
                    certificates only once
                </li>
                <li>It will help in spreading the benefits of reservations over a wider population</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The way forward</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The present move by the government to rethink OBC quota could potentially be used to ensure that we
                    have better data on caste-based disadvantages for future discourse
                </li>
                <li>It also indicates a mood that wants to ensure that the benefits of reservation are widely spread
                </li>
                <li>Increased attempts at linking benefits to Aadhaar allow us with an option to ensure that reservation
                    benefits are not captured by a few.
                </li>

        <div id="Business">
            <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Swachh Bharat Mission plans to achieve safe sanitation for all by 2019</li>
                <li>There is also a well-defined process, for the different phases of the mission, across the sanitation
                    value chain — build, use, maintain and treat (BUMT)
                </li>
                <li>So a national policy is in place; cities, state governments must operationalise it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Waste Management problem</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Nationally, we generate 7 million tonnes of fecal waste every day but there no systems in place to
                    safely dispose this waste
                </li>
                <li>It bears disease-carrying bacteria and pathogens posing a serious threat to safe and healthy
                    living.
                </li>
                <li>The truck operators can be monitored through GPS tracking process in order to ensure that they dump
                    the waste at treatment plants/pre-determined sites.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Fecal sludge management system (FSM)</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It involves collecting, transporting and treating fecal sludge and septage from pit latrines, septic
                    tanks or other onsite sanitation systems.
                </li>
                <li>This waste is then treated at septage treatment plants.</li>
                <li>The FSM ecosystem requires its stakeholders to collaborate closely.</li>
                <li>Citizens need to be aware about the importance of a regular schedule for desludging septic tanks.
                </li>
                <li>They must also be ready to pay part of the cost of running FS treatment plants through service
                    charges.
                </li>
                <li>Sanitation workers are key to an effective FSM system. But with no proper disposal system or safety
                    regulations in place, they face serious health hazards.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The sludge is nutrient-rich. After treatment, it can be given to farmers for use as organic
                    compost.
                </li>
                <li>It can even be treated and used for biogas, or to manufacture fuel pellets or ethanol.</li>
                <li>Once pathogens and bacteria are removed, the water can be used for irrigation, construction, by
                    industry in cooling plants etc
                </li>
                <li>With appropriate training, sanitation workers can be empowered to own and run FSM businesses — much
                    like the producer cooperatives of the agriculture sector.
                </li>

                <li>India has extended support to efforts of U.S. President Donald Trump to reform the UN, saying it
                    should include the expansion of the number of permanent and non-permanent members of the world body
                    to keep pace with the changed times
                </li>
                <li>During a discussion on UN reform, Mr. Trump insisted that he had always seen the “great potential”
                    of the organisation, but warned that “bureaucracy” was stopping it from realising its potential.

                <li>Deals with international child custody cases.</li>
                <li>Passed in 1980, the Hague Convention on International Child Abduction, which came into force in
                    1983, rules that in any child custody case, the court of the country where the child is a “habitual
                    resident” will adjudicate who will get custody.
                </li>
                <li>A total of ninety four countries, mostly developed nations in the Americas, Europe and Australia,
                    are signatories to the Hague Convention

                <li>The U.S. might push India to join the “Hague Convention” in this dialogue session.</li>
            </ol>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Legal provisions: </strong>The Hague Convention is circumventing the Indian system, and
                    India can’t abdicate its responsibility to Indian parents, mostly mothers, and their young children.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Separated parents: </strong>American officials say the problem arises when one parent is in
                    the U.S., while the other brings the child to India (their home country) to avoid an adverse
                    decision in the U.S. court.
                </li>
                <li>‘<strong>Women worst hit’:</strong> the worst affected in the cases covered by the convention are
                    women, who form 68% of the parents that take or “abduct” their children to their home countries, and
                    must be protected.

                <p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
                <p><strong><u>The Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA)</u></strong> The Prevention of Money
                    Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA) forms the core of the legal framework put in place by India to combat
                    money laundering. It came into force in 2005.</p>
                <p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The PMLA seeks to combat money laundering in India and has three main objectives:</li>
                    <li>To prevent and control money laundering</li>
                    <li>To confiscate and seize the property obtained from the laundered money; and</li>
                    <li>To deal with any other issue connected with money laundering in India</li>
                </ol>
                <p>PMLA defines money laundering offence and provides for the freezing, seizure and confiscation of the
                    proceeds of crime.</p>
                <p><strong>Salient Features</strong> :</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong> </strong>RBI, SEBI and IRDA have been brought under the PMLA, and therefore the
                        provisions of this act are applicable to all financial institutions, banks, mutual funds,
                        insurance companies, and their financial intermediaries.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The agency monitoring the anti-Money laundering activities in India is the Financial
                        Intelligence Unit (FIU-IND). This unit is responsible for receiving, processing, analysing and
                        disseminating information relating to suspect financial transactions. FIU-IND is also
                        responsible for coordinating and strengthening efforts of national and international
                        intelligence, investigation and enforcement agencies in pursuing the global efforts against
                        money laundering and related crimes. </strong></li>
                    <li>FIU-IND is an independent body reporting directly to the Economic Intelligence Council (EIC)
                        headed by the Finance Minister.
                    </li>
                    <li>Punishment for offence of money laundering: There can be punishment of imprisonment upto 3-7
                        years with fine upto 5 lakh rupees. But in case of offences done under Narcotic Drugs and
                        Psychotropic Substance Act 1985, maximum punishment is extent to 10 years rather than 7 years.

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gasification</strong> is a process that converts organic or fossil fuel based carbonaceous
                materials into carbon monoxide, hydrogen and carbon dioxide. This is achieved by reacting the material
                at high temperatures (&gt;700 °C), <strong>without combustion</strong>, <strong>with a controlled amount
                    of oxygen and/or steam</strong>. The resulting gas mixture is called syngas (from synthesis gas) or
                producer gas and is itself a fuel./su_spoiler]

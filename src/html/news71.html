        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>According to the committee, the government’s new system of rating officers on the basis of a
                    360-degree approach is susceptible to bias, manipulation and lacks fairness.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>360 degree approach:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The 360-degree approach is a new multi–source feedback system for performance appraisal of
                    bureaucrats.
                </li>
                <li>It relies on feedback of juniors and other colleagues for an all-round view, other than appraisal
                    reports written by senior officers.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Counter arguments:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Feedback in this process is obtained informally, making the process susceptible to being
                    manipulated.
                </li>
                <li>The report notes that the 360-degree approach does not have any statutory backing, or supported by
                    any Act.

                <li>The Logistics Data Bank (LDB) project, unveiled in July 2016 to make India’s logistics sector more
                    efficient through the use of Information Technology, will soon expand to country’s southern region
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What is The Logistics Data Bank (LDB) project?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The logistics Data Bank Service would bring efficiency in the current Logistics &amp; Supply Chain
                    through use of information technology that would be helpful for tracking and viewing the movement of
                    containers across the port to the ICD and end users.
                </li>
                <li>Every container is attached to a Radio Frequency Identification Tag (RFID) tag and then tracked
                    through RFID readers — aids importers and exporters in tracking their goods in transit.
                </li>
                <li>This has, in turn, cut the overall lead time of container movement as well as reduced transaction
                    costs that consignees and shippers incur.
                </li>
                <li>It is billed as a major ‘ease of doing business’ initiative aimed at boosting India’s foreign trade
                    and ensuring greater transparency.
                </li>
                <li>The project covers “the entire movement (of containers) through rail or road till the Inland

            <ul>
                <li>National Food Security Act, 2013, has met with prolonged political indifference</li>
                <li>Supreme Court directed Centre to ensure that States implement key aspects of the progressive law
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Key Aspects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Directives in the Swaraj Abhiyan case underscore that several State governments have not met key
                    requirements in the legislation.
                </li>
                <li>Sections 14, 15 and 16, require the setting up of a grievance redress mechanism and a State Food
                    Commission with responsibility to monitor the implementation of the law
                </li>
                <li>Article 256, which casts a responsibility on the States and the Union to ensure compliance with laws
                    made by Parliament, also provides the remedy, as it can be invoked by the Centre to set things
                    right.
                </li>
                <li>NFSA, which is vital for social security through the Public Distribution System and child welfare

                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Way forward</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Food security through the principle of universal access, though not every citizen would need it</li>
                <li>An in-built mechanisms to allow for the entry of new households that suddenly find themselves in
                    financial distress, while others can exit it based on changed circumstances.
                </li>
                <li>Full-fledged, independent machinery in the form of a Food Commission, and district-level grievance
                    redress, besides social audits. All these are provided for under the Act, but have been ignored
                </li>
                <li>Modernisation of the PDS, could incorporate dynamic features to the supply of subsidised food to
                    those who need it, and eliminate deficiencies and fraud.

        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>A new set of future satellites called <strong>hyperspectral imaging satellites</strong> is set to
                    add teeth to the way India is gleaned from about 600 km in space.
                </li>
                <li>The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) says it plans to launch a full-fledged niche Earth
                    observation (EO) satellite — called the <strong>Hyperspectral Imaging Satellite or HySIS </strong>—
                    using a critical chip it has developed.
                </li>
                <li>ISRO is endeavouring to enter the domain of operational hyperspectral imaging from earth orbit with
                    a satellite that can see in 55 spectral or colour bands from 630 km above ground.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Application:</strong> It can be used for a range of activities from monitoring the
                    environment, crops, looking for oil and minerals all the way up to military surveillance — all of
                    which need images that show a high level of differentiation of the object or scene.
                </li>
                <li>‘Hyspex’ imaging is said to enable distinct identification of objects, materials or processes on
                    Earth by reading the spectrum for each pixel of a scene from space.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Previous attempts:</strong> About a decade ago, ISRO added another EO niche with <strong>microwave
                    or radar imaging satellites RISAT-1 and 2</strong> that could ‘see’ through clouds and the dark — an
                    important feature useful for the military and security agencies.

                </li>

                </li>
                <li>Challenge: The challenge ahead is not only on how to encourage electric automobiles but also to take

            <ul>
                <li>Global experience indicates that most countries have adopted a technology-neutral approach</li>
                <li>And supported the full range of electric vehicle technologies till such time that they attained
                    market acceptability
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The way forward</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The government should push more aggressively for the BEV option for of two-wheelers and
                    three-wheelers
                </li>
                <li>And support the full range of electric technologies for other vehicle segments with a clear roadmap
                    for the evolution towards FCVs
                </li>
                <li>Hopefully, to reduce fossil fuel consumption, lower pollution and encourage electric mobility, a
                    more holistic approach will be adopted by the government

                <p>Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) is a tax avoidance strategy used by multinational companies,
                    wherein profits are shifted from jurisdictions that have high taxes (such as the United States and
                    many Western European countries) to jurisdictions that have low (or no) taxes (so-called tax
                    havens).</p></div>

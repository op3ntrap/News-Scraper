                <li>The Supreme Court has asked the Centre if state commissions for women (SCW) actually exist.</li>
                <li>The top court raised the question as it dealt with the issue of precarious conditions faced by
                    destitute widows living in Vrindavan and other places across the country.
                </li>
                <li>The court, which is hearing a matter pertaining to the condition of such widows, told the Centre
                    that if SCWs did not exist in the States, then the State governments concerned should be asked to
                    ensure setting up of such panels.
                </li>
                <li>‘<strong>No access to justice’</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Supreme Court observation:</strong> the ostracised destitute widows belong to the “socially
                    disadvantaged class” of society and were not treated with the dignity they deserve in the shelter
                    homes in Vrindavan and elsewhere. It had equated them with socially underprivileged groups who have
                    no real access to justice, are voiceless and needed to be empowered.

            <ul>
                <li>A plea has been filed in the Supreme Court for an early hearing of a petition challenging a 2011
                    government notification, which includes the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on the list of
                    <strong>“intelligence and security organisations</strong>” exempted from disclosing information to
                    the public under the Right to Information Act.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The Petition</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>According to the petition 2011 notification including the CBI in the Second Schedule of the Right to
                    Information (RTI) Act of 2005 was arbitrary, especially when the organisation was only an
                    investigating agency and not a security or intelligence organisation.
                </li>
                <li>It is alleged that it will scuttle the RTI appeal pending before the Chief Information Commissioner,
                    in regard to the Bofors-Quattrocchi case in which order was passed by the Central Information
                    Commission directing the CBI to provide the requisite papers to the petitioner.
                </li>
                <li>Also, by issuing the notification and placing the CBI in the Second Schedule, the government appears
                    to be claiming absolute secrecy for the CBI without the sanction of the law.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The Impact of the 2011 Government notification</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Such an administrative decision has a profound impact on the citizens of India inasmuch as it
                    restricts their fundamental right to information.
                </li>
                <li>By this notification the government could keep adding organisations to the Second Schedule, which do
                    not meet the express criteria laid down in Section 24(2) of the RTI Act and ultimately render the
                    RTI Act ineffective.

            <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The recent Criminal Laws (Rajasthan Amendment) Ordinance, 2017.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Ordinance protecting public servants</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Rajasthan ordinance making it a punishable offence to disclose the names of public servants
                    facing allegations of corruption before the government grants formal sanction to prosecute them
                </li>
                <li>It is a grave threat to media freedom and the public’s right to know</li>
                <li>Section 228-B, the newly introduced(through the ordinance) Indian Penal Code offence that relates to
                    acts done in the course of discharging official functions
                </li>
                <li>It prescribe a two-year prison term for disclosing the identity of the public servants concerned
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Other issues related to the ordinance</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Criminal Laws (Rajasthan Amendment) Ordinance, 2017 restricts judicial magistrates from ordering
                    an investigation without prior sanction
                </li>
                <li>It may even paralyse an impending probe, as no investigating agency can approach a sanctioning
                    authority without gathering any material
                </li>
                <li>It is an additional shield for public servants who already enjoy the protection of Section 197 of
                    the Code of Criminal Procedure, and Section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988
                </li>
                <li>The sections make prior sanction mandatory before a court can take cognizance of a case</li>
                <li>It may even paralyse an impending probe, as no investigating agency can approach a sanctioning
                    authority without gathering any material
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Other sanctions by Union and State governments, protecting public servants</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Union government, too, has a set of amendments to the Prevention of Corruption Act pending since
                    2013, including a proviso for prior sanction
                </li>
                <li>Provisions barring investigation or prosecution without prior sanction are also in force in
                    Maharashtra
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The Supreme Court verdicts:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The SC verdict of May 2014 striking down a statutory provision for prior government clearance for a
                    CBI probe against officials is very important
                </li>
                <li>The court had observed that such a provision destroys the objective of anti-corruption legislation,
                    blocks the truth from surfacing, thwarts independent investigation and forewarns corrupt officers
                </li>
                <li>Anti-corruption legislation in India seems to be in a state of unacceptable flux</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The way forward</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is time the Centre enforced a strong body of legislation that punishes the corrupt, protects the
                    honest, and ensures time-bound public services and whistle-blower safety
                </li>

                <li>The RBI is set to make Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) compulsory for companies having aggregate
                    fund-based and non-fund based exposure over Rs 5 crore
                </li>
                <li>Banks will be required to capture this number in the Central Repository of Information on Large
                    Credits (CRILC) database that captures details of loan above Rs 5 crore

            <ul>

                <li>The Sebi is looking to tighten listing norms to prevent fly-by-night operators from getting listed
                    on stock exchanges.
                </li>
                <li>These norms could be introduced as early as this month.</li>
                <li>The capital market regulator’s move follows the government’s ongoing crackdown on shell companies to
                    curb black money.
                </li>
                <li>Earlier, Sebi had imposed a partial trading ban on 331 firms termed as shell firms by the ministry
                    of corporate affairs.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>SEBI Norms</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sebi norms now specify that a company wishing to get listed needs to have a track record of
                    generating profits and distributing dividends for at least three of the five years preceding the
                    time it goes public, have a minimum net worth of Rs1 crore in each of the preceding three years and
                    have net tangible assets of at least Rs3 crore in each of the three preceding years.
                </li>
                <li>A company cannot make a share allotment in a public issue if the number of prospective allottees is
                    less than 1,000.
                </li>
                <li>A grading/rating system for initial public offerings have also been proposed so that investors have
                    a basic idea of the quality of the company they are investing in.
                </li>
                <li>This rating can be given either by a credit rating agency or any external expert or by Sebi
                    itself.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong> </strong><strong>Why this move by SEBI ?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sebi wants to ensure that companies with stronger businesses and a potential to maintain
                    profitability during the initial years of listing are allowed to go public.
                </li>
                <li>The plan is to increase the minimum net worth requirement, the proportion of assets held in tangible
                    form, the number of years of profitability and the minimum number of public investors to whom shares
                    are allotted.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Impact of this move</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>It may prevent many small genuine businesses from getting listed and raising capital from the public
                    to grow.
                </li>
                <li>However, it will definitely help to a large extent to ensure that only strong, mid-sized or larger
                    companies are able to get listed.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Way forward</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>There are more than 4,000 listed firms in the country. Of this, around 2,000 do not have enough
                    liquidity and are suspected to be involved in dubious transactions or manipulations to show business
                    only on paper.
                </li>
                <li>Firstly, action must be taken against companies that have defaulted and do not have enough
                    liquidity.
                </li>
                <li>Sebi should not abruptly put unnecessary regulatory burdens on genuine businesses</li>
            </ul>

                <li>The Indian economy is expected to see a rebound in the July-September quarter of this year</li>
                <li>GVA growth rate would be 6.3 percent, says a Nomura report</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Recovery underway</strong></p>

                <li>Nomura’s proprietary indices suggest that growth bottomed out in the second quarter</li>
                <li>A recovery is underway in the third quarter, largely because consumption and investment indicators
                    have improved in the third quarter
                </li>
                <li>Rural consumption indicators such as tractor and two-wheeler sales picked up sharply ahead of the
                    festive season, despite weak monsoon, likely reflecting improving cash levels with remonetization
                </li>
                <li>Urban consumption indicators such as passenger vehicle sales and consumer credit also improved in
                    the September quarter, relative to June quarter
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Annual growth figures</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>For this financial year, Nomura expects a GVA growth of 6.4 percent, slightly lower than the RBI’s
                    forecast of 6.7 percent
                </li>
                <li>This is partly because it expects the government to cut spending due to fiscal constraints</li>

                <li>It expects rates to stay unchanged in the base case</li>
                <li>This is due to incremental growth momentum headed higher, core inflation above 4 percent and fiscal

        <ol>
            <li>You are the Executive Director of an upcoming InfoTech Company which is making a name for itself in the
                market.<br/>Mr. A, who is a star performer, is heading the marketing team. In a short period of one
                year, he has helped in doubling the revenues as well as creating a high brand equity for the Company so
                much so that you are thinking of promoting him. However, you have been receiving information from many
                corners about his attitude towards the female colleagues; particularly his habit of making loose
                comments on women. In addition, he regularly sends indecent SMS’s to all the team members including his
                female colleagues.<br/>One day, late in the evening, Mrs. X, who is one of Mr. A’s team members, comes
                to you visibly disturbed. She complains against the continued misconduct of Mr. A, who has been making
                undesirable advances towards her and has even tried to touch her inappropriately in his cabin. She
                tenders her resignation and leaves your office. <br/>a) What are the options available to you?<br/>b)
                Evaluate each of these options and choose the option you would adopt, giving reasons.

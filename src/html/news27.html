                                In-person interviews are also taken to check the ‘low-risk’ status of the applicants
                                before the enrollment. Apart from this, the travellers may further be questioned when
                                they enter the United States in case the need arises.

                            <li>The World Health Organization (WHO) released new advice to countries, recommending the
                                use of <strong>multi-disease testing devices for Tuberculosis, HIV and
                                    Hepatitis.</strong></li>
                            <li>A single device called the <strong>GeneXpert</strong> can be used to diagnose TB and HIV
                                infections, and quantitatively measure HIV and hepatitis C viral loads.
                            </li>
                            <li>India recently procured 600 GeneXpert machines for the National Tuberculosis

                            <li>Multi-disease devices can increase system efficiencies and improve access to testing for

</strong><strong>CERT-In:&#13;
</strong>The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) is an office within the Ministry &#13;
of Electronics and Information Technology.&#13;
&#13;
It is the nodal agency to deal with cyber security threats like hacking and phishing.&#13;
It strengthens security-related defence of the Indian Internet domain.&#13;
&#13;
A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed in May, 2016 between Indian Computer &#13;
Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) and Ministry of Cabinet Office, UK.&#13;
&#13;
Earlier CERT-In signed MoUs with counterpart/similar organizations in about &#13;
seven countries - Korea, Canada, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, Japan and Uzbekistan.&#13;
&#13;
Ministry of External Affairs has also signed MoU with Cyber Security as one of the &#13;
areas of cooperation with <strong>Shanghai Cooperation Organization</strong><span>.&#13;
&#13;
</span>With the MoUs, participating countries can exchange technical information on Cyber attacks,&#13;
response to cyber security incidents and find solutions to counter the cyber attacks.&#13;
&#13;
They can also exchange information on prevalent cyber security policies and best practices. &#13;
&#13;
The MoUs helps to strengthen cyber space of signing countries, capacity building and improving&#13;
relationship between them.</pre>

                <li><strong>Supreme Court: </strong>A certificate of residency issued by a gram panchayat is not a
                    document of citizenship and is “meaningless” unless supported by some other valid record to make a
                    claim for inclusion in the National Register of Citizenship (NRC).

                <li>The apex court was hearing a batch of pleas challenging the Gauhati High Court order holding that a

                    valid document for claim to citizenship.
                </li>
                <li>About 48 lakh claims have been made using certificates issued by gram panchayat secretaries, out of
                    a total of 3.29 crore claims made so far for inclusion in the NRC which is being prepared in Assam

                <li>A Pakistani court ordered the release of <strong>Hafiz Saeed</strong>, the chief of <strong>Jamaat-ud-Dawa
                    (JuD)</strong> and one of the alleged masterminds of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks that killed more
                    than 160 people.
                </li>
                <li>A review Board of the Lahore High Court overruled the government’s request to extend the detention
                    citing that Saeed’s release may trigger international sanctions against Pakistan.
                </li>
                <li>The review board looking into the case has refused to extend his house arrest as the government
                    failed to provide any evidence against the charges.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Saeed, who carries a bounty of $10 million announced by the U.S. for his role in terror
                            activities, has been under house arrest since January this year.
                        </li>
                        <li>Last month, authorities had withdrawn terrorism charges against Saeed and the JuD, a front
                            of the terror organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba, and kept him in detention under the Maintenance
                            of Public Order Act, paving the way for his release.
                        </li>
                        <li>Saeed’s detention was extended four times since January when the government cracked down on
                            the JuD and its charity arm Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation.

            <ul>
                <li>Bankchain is a consortium of 27 banks (22 of them are Indian) of which the State Bank of India (SBI)
                    was the first Indian member
                </li>
                <li>It is working to devise blockchain-based solutions for banking and, along with the SBI, planning to
                    launch a beta program to use smart contracts next month
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>About Blockchain and bitcoin</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>In late 2008, an unknown person (or group) named Satoshi Nakamoto created a crypto-currency,
                    bitcoin
                </li>
                <li>Its novelty consists in the fact that its operations are authorized without any trusted third-party
                    carrying out administrative or security tasks
                </li>
                <li>This minimizes the transaction fees eventually weighing on users and considerably reducing the time
                    for processing the operations
                </li>
                <li>Centralized networks rely on one or more trusted bodies (for example, banks) to keep a detailed
                    record of transactions and update users’ balance
                </li>
                <li>Bitcoin, on the other hand, decentralizes the administrative activity and lets “miners” process the
                    transactions carried out in the system
                </li>
                <li>The transparency, accessibility and stability of the transactions’ record are ensured by the public
                    broadcasting of the operations throughout the nodes of the network (the computers running the
                    software)
                </li>
                <li>And their subsequent addition to a shared database containing the complete transaction history for
                    any given bitcoin
                </li>
                <li>This shared ledger is called the “blockchain”, i.e the sequence of all the verified “blocks” of
                    transactions, recorded chronologically—timestamped—one after the other
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Usability:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Just as bitcoin uses the blockchain to maintain a ledger of a crypto-currency, the blockchain can be
                    used to keep track of the ownership of any asset or data that can be digitized and represented by
                    computer code
                </li>
                <li>Once the asset is on blockchain, users can compose smart contracts that contain the terms of the
                    agreement, and automatically execute them once certain predetermined conditions are satisfied
                </li>
                <li>They roughly follow the scheme of an “if-then” function
                    <ul>
                        <li>For example, if the smart contract relates to the acquisition of an intellectual property
                            right licence, Party A creates a smart contract to which the licence X is permanently
                            attached, programming that X is to be released upon certain conditions Y, and launches it
                            into a blockchain
                        </li>
                        <li>Whenever Party B wishes to obtain the information/licence, they transfer consideration Y to
                            the protocol
                        </li>
                        <li>Automatically, the smart contract algorithm releases X to party B and delivers Y to Party A,
                            eliminating delays and room for non-compliance
                        </li>
                        <li>Once the obligation is fulfilled on the one side (Y), the computer protocol autonomously
                            performs the other side of the agreement (X)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Disadvantages of traditional contracts:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Traditional contracts are always subject to a degree of uncertainty with respect to their final
                    outcome
                </li>
                <li>Smart contracts leave no room for voluntary breaches of the agreement</li>
                <li>By entrusting the network with the performance of the agreed terms, they reduce the likelihood of
                    expensive and time-consuming disputes
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why are banks reluctant to Blockchain?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Smart contracts on a decentralized, “permission-less” blockchain like bitcoin don’t allow any
                    meddling by third parties
                </li>
                <li>This is because in a permission-less system, any computer can join as a node to run the code and
                    amending the leger will require access to all the nodes
                </li>
                <li>Banks are uncomfortable with losing control of the system and they prefer “permissioned” blockchains
                    like Bankchain
                </li>
                <li>Bankchain restricts the access to nodes to other banks, while individual customers can join as users
                    after complying with know your customer (KYC) norms
                </li>
                <li>Pre-selected nodes allow banks to intervene between transactions, providing the ‘emergency entry’
                    into the system whenever interventions are deemed appropriate
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Currently each bank carries out its own KYC process.</li>
                <li>This can be done by one bank and securely uploaded on the blockchain, thereafter shared with the
                    other banks once the trigger is generated by the customer
                </li>
                <li>Smart contracts can automatically release insurance payments for verifiable claims like delayed
                    flights, motor accidents or death
                </li>
                <li>This would involve bringing authorized third parties like hospitals and garages to join a single
                    platform with insurers and the insured, and bring process efficiencies
                </li>
                <li>Most securities have settlement delays of two days or longer that can be brought down to minutes,
                    which will also reduce working capital requirements for collateral
                </li>
                <li>Other applications include crowdfunding for small businesses, enabling the trading of tokenized
                    equity shares and settlement of syndicated loans between banks
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Threats:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>While permissioned blockchains bring many benefits of a decentralized network, they compromise on
                    the promise of immutability by limiting the nodes in the system
                </li>
                <li>The unlimited nodes in bitcoin make it tamperproof while pre-selected nodes in a permissioned
                    blockchain allow authorities to intervene between transactions and expose the points of
                    vulnerability
                </li>
                <li>It is quite unsure that banks can provide the same level of data integrity that is guaranteed by
                    permission-less blockchains like bitcoin
                </li>

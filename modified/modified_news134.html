            </p>
            <p>
                (3) Where any party against whom an interim order, whether by way of injunction or stay or in any other

                    In news:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Supreme Court has ruled that insurance claims cannot be denied to a person merely on the grounds
                    of delay in filing the claim, holding that “mechanical” denials on technical bases will cause people
                    to lose confidence in the industry.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Supreme Court set aside the verdicts of various consumer courts, including the National Consumer
                    Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC), which had ruled that insurance companies could deny the
                    benefit of cover for delay in filing the claims.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Judgment:
                    </strong>
                    “It is true that the owner has to intimate the insurer immediately after the theft of the vehicle.
                    However, this condition should not bar settlement of genuine claims, particularly when the delay in
                    intimation or submission of documents is due to unavoidable circumstances. The decision of the
                    insurer to reject the claim has to be based on valid grounds. Rejection of the claims on purely
                    technical grounds in a mechanical manner will result in loss of confidence of policyholders in the
                    insurance industry,”.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The verdict would bring big relief to people who fail to file insurance claims immediately after
                    their vehicles are damaged in accidents or stolen.

                <li>
                    Women below 45, however, will have to be accompanied by male Mehrams, according to the policy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It also proposes to increase the quota for Mehrams from 200 to 500.

                    Key Points:

                <li>
                    The proposed Haj Policy 2018-22, by a panel headed by former secretary Afzal Amanullah, also
                    recommends bringing down the number of embarkation points (EPs) from which pilgrims can take flights
                    to Saudi Arabia from the present 21 to nine.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The policy has been drafted in light of a 2012 Supreme Court order asking the Centre to abolish the
                    subsidy gradually by 2022
                </li>
                <li>
                    India has an annual Haj quota of 1.7 lakh devotees
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Practice at present:
                </strong>
                Till now, women devotees could not travel without a male Mehram. The term Mehram refers to a male a
                woman cannot marry at anytime in her life (i.e. father, brother or son, etc). The cut in funds meant for
                subsidy will be used for educational empowerment and welfare of Muslims.

                    The recent tension between India and China has prompted the government here to think of measures to
                    reduce its dependence on China for pharmaceutical products.

                    The health ministry along with drug regulators is planning to take a series of measures to limit
                    reliance on China as well as tighten the regulatory checks and balances to ensure only

                    Key Points:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Currently, India gets 70-80% of its medicines and medical devices supplies, including raw material
                    for pharmaceuticals (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient) from China.
                    <strong>
                        This poses a major risk of severe drug shortage if India’s diplomatic relations with China
                        worsen.
                    </strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The landed price of API from China in India is 15-20% less than its production cost here, making it
                    more viable for companies to import.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        In fact, in 2014, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval had also warned the government about
                        India’s over-dependence on China for API and how tension between the two countries can cause a
                        crisis in the public health system of India.
                    </strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Following Doval’s alert, the government had formed a committee of experts to formulate a specific
                    policy to boost API manufacturing in India.
                </li>
                <li>
                    India was once a favoured destination for sourcing low-cost, good quality raw material for
                    manufacturing medicines. Gradually, China has taken over this bulk drug market globally in the past
                    few years by creating huge capacities.

                    Displaying convergence of interests with the new quadrilateral grouping with U.S., Japan and
                    Australia, India reached out to China’s backyard, addressing an array of issues ranging from the
                    tension in the Korean peninsula to freedom of navigation and sought a crackdown on chemical weapons
                    during the ASEAN and the East Asia summits.

                <li>
                    A high-level Indian official told The Hindu that New Delhi has emerged as a more dependable partner
                    for South-East Asia following the Doklam faceoff with China, and indicated that the South-East Asian
                    countries expect New Delhi to be assertive with Beijing.

                <li>
                    India remains concerned about China’s manmade structures in the South China Sea that are likely to
                    create navigational problems and international friction
                </li>
                <li>
                    Southeast Asian region had been facing uncertainties following the exit of President Barack Obama as

                    Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared concerns of DPRK’s pursuit of missiles and nuclear weapons and

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QSD) was an informal strategic dialogue between the United
                    States, Japan, Australia and India that was maintained by talks between member countries.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The dialogue was initiated in 2007 by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, with the support of Vice
                    President Dick Cheney of the US, Prime Minister John Howard of Australia and Prime Minister Manmohan
                    Singh of India.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Japan President Shinzo Abe delivered a speech to the Indian Parliament in August 2007, entitled a
                    “confluence of the two seas”, a phrase he took from the title of a book written by Mughal prince
                    Dara Shikoh.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The dialogue was paralleled by joint military exercises of an unprecedented scale, titled Exercise
                    Malabar.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The diplomatic and military arrangement was widely viewed as a response to increased Chinese
                    economic and military power, and the Chinese government responded to the Quadrilateral dialogue by
                    issuing formal diplomatic protests to its members.

                </li>
                <li>
                    The Quadrilateral was supposed to establish an “Asian Arc of Democracy,” envisioned to ultimately
                    include countries in central Asia, Mongolia, the Korean peninsula, and other countries in Southeast
                    Asia: “virtually all the countries on China’s periphery, except for China itself.”

                    Convened around the theme of a “free and open Indo-Pacific,” the first quadrilateral meeting
                    addressed seven core themes: the rules-based order in Asia, freedom of navigation and overflight in
                    the maritime commons, respect for international law, enhancing connectivity, maritime security, the
                    North Korean threat and nonproliferation, and terrorism.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The agreements on terror financing, chemical weapons and de-radicalisation adopted at the East Asia
                    Summit will help the region cope with the threat of terrorism effectively in future.

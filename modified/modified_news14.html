                                In its letter, the EC has cited examples of its counterparts abroad. For instance, the
                                Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), can initiate contempt proceedings against anyone
                                sullying its image. This year, the ECP issued a contempt notice to
                                cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan for accusing the election body of bias in a case
                                of foreign funding.

                                    Declaring a site as an Important Bird and Biodiversity Area does not ensure that the
                                    site gets legal protection or becomes inaccessible to people. Instead BirdLife
                                    International encourages national and State governments to recognise the areas as
                                    sites of vital importance for conservation of wildlife and to empower local
                                    community-based conservation initiatives.

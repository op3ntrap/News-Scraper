                        Over the last 30-40 years, India has developed the capability to engineer and build globally
                        competitive vehicles based on internal combustion engines (ICEs). Via joint ventures, technology
                        licences and technology transfer, Indian manufacturers and suppliers have built full-fledged

                        The RBI’s asset quality review has revealed that the gross NPA ratio of both public and private
                        sector banks is higher than was earlier thought

                    <li>
                        But in the PSU banks, it is alarming at about 12%

                    <li>
                        And this is an underestimate, because it does not include assets that are “stressed” but not yet

                    <li>

                    <li>
                        If no one is willing to take over, or the banks don’t accept the debt reduction implied by the

                    <li>
                        The process changes the incentive structure facing bank managements by giving them a legally

                        of the project)

                    <li>
                        Since the alternative is liquidation, they(bank) should be willing to accept any haircut that
                        gives them more than they would get from liquidation

                        In 2015, the finance ministry had estimated that the PSU banks needed Rs2.4 trillion of capital

                    <li>
                        Of this capital Rs1.1 trillion was to come from the market, Rs60,000 crore from retained
                        profits, and the remaining Rs 70,000 crore from the budget
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        But this is clearly insufficient because the NPA situation has turned out to be much worse than
                        expected

                    <li>
                        Fitch Ratings has estimated that Indian PSU banks will need as much as Rs4 trillion of capital
                        by end of March 2019 to meet the capital requirements under Basel III
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The scope for using public funds to recapitalize the PSU banks can only be judged on the basis
                        of a holistic view of the many other demands for government expenditure

                        We cannot keep stimulate the economy through increased government expenditure

                    <li>
                        And without without a clear view of how much of the capital requirement of the PSU banks has to

                        Reforms in PSU banks are expected to make the banks more efficient

                    <li>
                        The idea of merging PSBs, is not reform at all
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Merging strong banks with other banks will do nothing to improve the average balance sheet

                    <li>
                        The most important reform will be to reduce the government’s equity to 33% in selected PSU banks

                    <li>
                        This would allow the stronger PSU banks to raise additional capital from the market, including
                        from possible strategic investors(who could be offered seats on the board)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The inclusion of strategic investors, with representation on the board, may make it easier to
                        raise capital without burdening the budget

                    <li>
                        If the budget is under stress, all PSBs need not be recapitalized to ensure targeted growth in
                        lending
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Weak banks that have eroded their capital very substantially should be subjected to the RBI’s
                        “prompt corrective action” discipline

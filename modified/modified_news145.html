                    The Supreme Court has made it mandatory for the railways to keep oxygen cylinders in all trains to
                    ensure that the life-saving gas could be provided to travellers suffering from respiratory problems

                    The Supreme Court also directed the railways to take assistance of doctors from AIIMS to explore
                    ways to put in place a system in moving trains to provide medical treatment to travellers if they

                    In this period of uncertainty and angst, India needs a reliable partner on the world stage. U.S

                    China’s provocative actions in the South China Sea directly challenge the international law and

                    The world’s center of gravity is shifting to the heart of the Indo-Pacific. The United States and
                    India – with our shared goals of peace, security, freedom of navigation, and a free and open
                    architecture – must serve as the eastern and western beacons of the Indo-Pacific.

                    We need to collaborate with India to ensure that the Indo-Pacific is increasingly a place of peace,
                    stability, and growing prosperity – so that it does not become a region of disorder, conflict and
                    predatory economics.

                    Tillerson also issued a blunt warning to China’s client state Pakistan, saying “states that use
                    terror as an instrument of policy will only see their international reputation and standing

                    : Liquid gas contracts are shedding their rigidity and becoming more flexible as regional systems
                    gradually merge into an interlinked global market in an oversupplied situation.

                <li>
                    Flexible contract regime will help optimise cost of supplies and allow countries such as India to
                    rapidly develop a gas-driven economy as part of strategy to reduce carbon footprint.

                <li>
                    Till now liquid gas trade has been confined to regional contracts with rigid terms, often biased in
                    favour of the seller and offering little legroom for buyers. This is changing in the wake of fall in
                    gas prices in tune with drop in oil prices and rise of the US

                            Fracking is a term used for hydraulic fracturing, which is the process of creating fractures
                            in rocks and rock formations by injecting specialized fluid into cracks to force them to
                            open further. The larger fissures allow more oil and gas to flow out of the formations and
                            into the wellbore, from where they can be easily extracted.

                            Fracking has resulted in many oil and gas wells attaining a state of economic viability due
                            to the level of extraction that can be reached, and has allowed drilling firms access to
                            previously difficult-to-reach sources of oil and gas.

                    The think tank questioned the central committee, headed by IARI scientist Anupam Verma, which had in
                    2015 reviewed the use of these pesticides but preferred not to ban them immediately.

                    Seven hazardous pesticides are on the list of

                    equipment that is uncomfortable, expensive or not readily available should be avoided, especially in
                    the case of small-scale users and farm workers in hot climates.

                    Higher-rated corporates have in recent days chosen to borrow from the markets rather than from banks

                    Bankers and sector analysts have in recent days made a case for measuring credit growth in terms of
                    outstandings on loans as well as bonds as better-rated corporates are borrowing increasingly from

                You are a young, aspiring and sincere employee in a Government office working as an assistant, to the
                director of your department. Since you’ve joined recently, you need to learn and progress. Luckily your
                superior is very kind and ready to train you for your job. He is a very intelligent and well-informed
                person having knowledge of various departments. In short, you respect your boss and are looking forward
                to learn a lot from him.
                <br/>
                Since you’ve good tuning with the boss, he started depending on you. One day due to ill health he
                invited you at his place for finishing some urgent work. You reached his house and you heard shouting
                noises before you could ring the bell. You waited for a while. After entering, boss greeted you and
                explained the work. But you were constantly disturbed by the crying of a woman. At last, you inquired
                with the boss but his answer did not satisfy you. Next day, you were compelled to inquire further in the
                office and found out that his behavior is very bad at home with his wife. He also beat up his wife.
                <br/>
                His wife is not well educated and is a simple woman in comparison to her husband. You see that though
                your boss is a nice person in the office, he is engaged in domestic violence at home. In such a
                situation, you are left with the following options. Analyze each option with its consequences.
                <br/>
                I. Just ignore thinking about it because it is their personal matter.
                <br/>
                II. Report the case to the appropriate authority.
                <br/>

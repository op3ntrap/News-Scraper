                        targets ahead of climate change negotiations under the Paris climate agreement which begins in
                        the German city Bonn, as the latest data shows that carbon emissions in 2016 was the highest

                    Dredging is a digging activity usually carried out underwater, in shallow seas or freshwater areas
                    with the purpose of gathering up bottom sediments and widening.

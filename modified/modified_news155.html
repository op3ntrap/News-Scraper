                <li>
                    President Ram Nath Kovind suggested that a system be evolved for providing certified copies of High
                    Court judgments translated in
                    <strong>
                        local or regional languages of the litigants.
                    </strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Copies of the translated judgments could be provided in 24 or 36 hours after the verdict was
                    pronounced.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The President pointed out that the High Courts delivered judgments in English, “but we are a country
                    of diverse languages. The litigant may not be conversant with English and the finer points of the
                    judgment may escape him or her. The litigating parties will thus be dependent on the lawyer or
                    another person to translate the judgment. This can add to time and cost”.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It was important not only to take justice to the people but also to make it understandable to the
                    litigating parties in a language they know

                    Days before the Gujarat Assembly elections were announced, the State government renewed its bid to
                    revive the controversial
                    <strong>
                        Gujarat Control of Terrorism and Organised Crime (GCTOC) Bill, 2015
                    </strong>
                    , which authorises police officers to tap phones and submit the conversations as evidence in court.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Bill includes provisions to file a charge sheet within 180 days instead of the usual 90 and
                    proposes stricter conditions for granting bail.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Union Home Ministry has sent the Bill for inter-ministerial consultations, the fifth time since
                    it was first conceived in 2003 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Former President Pranab Mukherjee had refused to clear the Bill, following which the Home Ministry
                    recalled it in January 2016.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Ministry asked the State government for clarifications, and Gujarat had sent a fresh proposal
                    this September.

                    </strong>
                    was reintroduced as
                    <strong>
                        GCTOC Bill in 2015
                    </strong>
                    . The same year the Information and Technology Ministry objected to the provisions that allowed
                    “authorisation of interception of telephonic conversations and their admissibility as evidence in
                    the court of law”.

                    Intelligence, the Enforcement Directorate and the police can tap phones only with the permission of
                    the Union Home Secretary.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Bill in its earlier form was rejected thrice by two former Presidents — the late A.P.J. Abdul

                    One of the provisions to which objections were raised by the Centre was Section 25, which provided

                    be done in pursuance of this Act.”

                    According to sources, the offer was made by the Pakistan Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed

                    </strong>
                    that lapsed in 2015, President Ghani repeated concerns that trade with India over the Wagah border
                    had been blocked by Pakistan, despite being agreed to in the APTTA.
                </li>

                    Days later, Indian officials at the

                    </strong>

                <li>
                    Exasperated by Pakistan’s refusal to allow the truck trade, President Ghani has said repeatedly that
                    he would cut off Pakistan’s access to Central Asia and issued a decree last week cancelling
                    permission for Pakistani trucks to transit through Afghanistan.

                    Stressing that food being served under the mid-day meal scheme and Integrated Child Development
                    Scheme (ICDS) do not guarantee the protein intake as envisaged, the National Human Rights Commission
                    (NHRC) has recommended to state governments and the Ministry of Women and Child Development to
                    introduce eggs and milk as part of the meal in all states.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The recommendation was made during a conference organised by the NHRC on the implementation of the
                    National Food Security Act, 2013 on Friday.

                    Malnutrition continues to haunt India despite economic growth and the mid day meal scheme and the
                    ICDS are the two biggest nutrition programmes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    While the meal is supplied in schools, the ICDS aims at providing supplementary nutrition through
                    anganwadi centres to children aged below 6 years, besides pregnant and lactating women.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    For the ICDS scheme, it has been recommended that adequate food testing facilities be created
                    preferably at the district level by all states through the public health department, universities
                    and colleges.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For the meal scheme, it was recommended that social audit and evaluation by a third party be
                    conducted annually for each district and the reports be published on state portals.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It also said that no child should be deprived of the meal because of non-linking of Aadhaar.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The NHRC also questioned the state governments whether they have strictly followed Supreme Court
                    orders banning contractors in supplying nutrition under ICDS and also whether adequate funds have
                    been made available for full implementation of the Maternity Benefit Scheme or not.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Moreover, experts said cash transfers instead of hot cooked meals may be counterproductive and must
                    not be encouraged as cash can be used for other expenditure.

                    Citing Kerala and Tamil Nadu as examples, the states were asked to resolve infrastructural gaps in
                    terms of buildings, kitchens, drinking water supply and toilets within three years, by sourcing
                    funds from different schemes and departments.

                    The Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals — more commonly abbreviated
                    to just the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) or the Bonn Convention — aims to conserve
                    terrestrial, marine and avian migratory species throughout their range. It is an international
                    treaty, concluded under the aegis of the United Nations Environment Programme, concerned with the
                    conservation of wildlife and habitats on a global scale

                <li>
                    Since the Convention’s entry into force, its membership has grown steadily to include over 120
                    Parties from Africa, Central and South America, Asia, Europe and Oceania.

                    The Convention was signed in 1979 in Bad Godesberg, a suburb of Bonn (hence the name), and entered
                    into force in 1983. The depositary is the government of the Federal Republic of Germany.

                    The CMS is the only global and UN-based intergovernmental organization established exclusively for
                    the conservation and management of terrestrial, aquatic and avian migratory species throughout their
                    range. CMS and its daughter agreements determine policy and provide further guidance on specific
                    issues through their Strategic Plans, Action Plans, resolutions, decisions and guidelines. All
                    maintain on their websites a list of all decisions taken, guidelines issues and Action Plans adopted
                    by the Member States.

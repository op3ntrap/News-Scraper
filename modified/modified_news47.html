                        Context
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        By ordering an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation into more than 80 cases of
                        suspected extra-judicial killings in Manipur, the Supreme Court has reiterated the principle of
                        accountability as an essential part of the rule of law.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        These cases involved either suspected fake encounters or the use of excessive or retaliatory
                        force.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Even after this ruling on petitions demanding an inquiry into 1,528 deaths in counter-insurgency
                        operations in Manipur, the Attorney General had argued against the court ordering an
                        investigation into some specific instances.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>

                        What the SC has said?
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The court has rightly rebuffed an attempt by the government to stall any probe into these deaths
                        on the ground that they were too old to be raked up now.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It has taken the view that the killing of a person who was possibly innocent cannot be
                        overlooked owing to mere lapse of time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The state cannot take advantage of its own inaction and scuttle a probe by citing the delay as a
                        reason.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Last year, the court had ruled that the armed forces cannot escape investigation for excesses
                        even in places where they enjoy special powers, and that the legal protection provided by the
                        Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, or AFSPA, will have to yield to the principles of human
                        rights.

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        AG had come up with the unpalatable argument that inquiries conducted by the authorities in
                        Manipur were biased in favour of the citizens owing to local pressure and the ground situation.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Court’s response
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The court stood firm in its assessment, deprecating the suggestion that all inquiries were
                        biased and motivated.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The court’s order is yet another reminder that AFSPA has contributed to the climate of impunity
                        in States where it is in force, especially in Manipur, and this may trigger a fresh demand for
                        its repeal.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Another worrying aspect in the domain of human rights is that the National Human Rights
                        Commission has been reduced to a “toothless tiger”.

                        It is grossly understaffed despite its increasing workload, and many State governments show
                        little respect for its guidelines and instructions.

                    <li>
                        The court’s directive that the Centre take note of the NHRC’s concerns and remedy the situation
                        could not have come a day too soon.

                        Though the actual prevalence of MDR-TB among children in India is not known, the results from a
                        limited number of children tested in this sample, under the Revised National TB Control
                        Programme, is worrying.

                        cities, about 10% showed resistance to Rifampicin, a first-line drug.

                    <li>
                        In line with World Health Organisation guidelines, the RNTCP requires all household contacts,
                        particularly children, of a newly diagnosed pulmonary TB patient to be tested and started on
                        treatment if needed.

                    <li>
                        Children below six years of age in the household of a newly diagnosed patient are required to be

                    <li>
                        A proactive approach to testing helps in early and correct diagnosis of all contacts and in
                        cutting the transmission chain.

                    <li>
                        Unfortunately, as several studies have shown, the RNTCP guidelines on contact screening are
                        heeded mostly in the breach.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The results from this limited study should now compel the government to take up contact
                        screening more urgently.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In 2010, WHO had revised the dosage of certain TB drugs for children. Fixed-dose combination
                        (FDC) drugs that take into account the revised dosages for children were finally made available
                        in late 2015.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The FDCs are meant for treating children with drug-susceptible TB and cannot be used to treat
                        children who require second-line drugs or who have MDR-TB. After more than a year’s delay, a few
                        months ago India finally introduced FDCs in six States.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The remaining States will be covered by the end of this year. Adherence to treatment will
                        improve, and correct dosage for children weighing less than 25 kg will become easier when
                        child-friendly FDCs become available throughout the country.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using the Xpert molecular diagnostic test to screen children with TB is a positive step and
                        should be welcomed, but all the diagnosed children should be guaranteed paediatric FDCs. It
                        would be unethical to deny them this lifeline.

                            Scientists from the University of Cambridge have developed super-stretchy and strong
                            artificial silk, composed almost entirely of water, which may be used to make eco-friendly
                            textiles and sensors.

                        <li>
                            The fibres, which resemble miniature bungee cords as they can absorb large amounts of
                            energy, are sustainable, non-toxic and can be made at room temperature.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The fibres are spun from a soupy material called a hydrogel, which is 98% water.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The remaining 2% of the hydrogel is made of silica and cellulose, both naturally available
                            materials, held together in a network by barrel-shaped molecular “handcuffs” known as
                            cucurbiturils. The chemical interactions between the different components enable long fibres
                            to be pulled from the gel, said the researchers.

                            Although these fibres are not as strong as the strongest spider silks, they can support
                            stresses in the range of 100 to 150 megapascals, which is similar to other synthetic and
                            natural silks. However, these fibres are non-toxic and far less energy-intensive to make.

                            Dissent has crept in among agricultural scientists of the National Academy of Agricultural
                            Sciences (NAAS) over the possible release of genetically modified mustard.

                            In May, NAAS President wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, endorsing DMH-11, a variety of
                            mustard developed by Deepak Pental of Delhi University, a NAAS Fellow, that employs genes
                            from soil bacterium.

                            If approved, it would be the first transgenic edible crop to be grown in Indian fields.

                        <li>
                            The plant had gone through adequate tests and was declared “safe” and passed regulatory
                            muster.

                            is a hybrid variety of mustard developed by crossing a traditional variety of mustard,
                            called Varuna, and an East European variety.

                        <li>
                            DMH-11 did not perform as well as several other varieties and mustard hybrids and that the
                            Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), the Environment Ministry body that cleared
                            DMH-11, was riddled by a “conflict of interest.”

                            Using genetically-modified technology to produce hybrid seed varieties was a “failed
                            experiment” as evidenced by the experience of Bt cotton.

                            2006, largely due to insect resistance, and that it nearly tripled the cost of producing
                            cotton between 2006-2013.

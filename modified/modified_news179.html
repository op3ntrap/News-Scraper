                    With Moody’s Investors Services issuing a clear warning, that India’s rating upgrade could be
                    downgraded if its fiscal metrics and the outlook for general government fiscal consolidation
                    deteriorates materially.

                    High debt/GDP ratio is likely to increase in the next two years on slower growth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    More worrying will be how the deficit of states plays out in the wake of GST.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Reasons for increase in trend in Fiscal Deficit:
                </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Burgeoning bad loans
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fresh uncertainty on the revenue projections from the GST front
                </li>
                <li>
                    Slack private investments and subdued non-tax revenue trends.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Due to problem areas like power and telecom, farm loan waivers and Rs 2.11 lakh crore bank
                    recapitalisation (to be funded by recap bonds).
                </li>
                <li>
                    So the actual fiscal deficit could turn out to be much larger.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Therefore, the government’s fiscal deficit target of 3.2 per cent of the GDP may come at a cost of
                    over Rs 70,000-crore cut in capital expenditure, according to an SBI research report.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Fiscal glide path:
                </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The government hopes to maintain its fiscal glide path.
                </li>
                <li>
                    But many analysts are not a convinced, according to them even as reform measures will reduce the
                    risk of sharp rise in debt but near-term concerns persist in terms of government adhering to its
                    fiscal glide path especially in the light of the incremental spending undertaken to boost economic
                    growth
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Key points:
                </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The upgrade has come after India’s economic growth unexpectedly slowed to 5.7 per cent in the June
                    quarter, the slowest in three years, amid the disruption caused by the rollout of the GST and
                    demonetisation shock.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The removal of a number of commodities from the two highest tax brackets to lower brackets is
                    unlikely to help matters on the revenue front.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The first volume of the Economic Survey released in January had projected growth in the range of
                    6.75-7.5 per cent in 2017-18 against 7.1 per cent in 2016-17.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Index for Industrial Production (IIP) growth fell to 2.5 per cent in first six months of 2017-18
                    as against 5.8 per cent in same period of last year.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Given the evident pressures on the fiscal front and the likelihood that the government may not even
                    meet this year’s and next year’s fiscal target, the rating upgrade seems to have come at a wrong
                    time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Markets should worry that the government, now having received the rating upgrade, may actually
                    slacken and relax its commitment to reducing fiscal deficit, as per the stated plan.

                    The Kazipally well, along with ditches, lakes, and rivers around the pharmaceutical cluster,

                <li>
                    When these antibiotics come in contact with pathogenic bacteria (which cause disease in humans), the

                    One study from Delhi’s Ganga Ram hospital found that between 2002 and 2009, among patients infected
                    by Klebsiella pneumoniae (a pneumonia-causing bacterium), the percentage of these pathogens that
                    were resistant to carbapenems grew from 2% to 52%

            <ul>
                <li>
                    A big driver of resistance is the overuse of these drugs
                </li>
                <li>
                    When people take antibiotics they don’t need, for a viral flu, for instance, the bacteria in their
                    body learn to tolerate these drugs by acquiring resistance genes
                </li>
                <li>
                    Resistance genes don’t come out of nowhere – some of them have existed for decades in soil and
                    water, helping environmental bacteria fight natural antibiotics
                </li>
                <li>
                    Studies in Hyderabad’s pharmaceutical cluster now show that the large doses of man-made antibiotics
                    in pollution hotspots like Kazipally force these environmental bacteria to evolve by boosting the
                    numbers of resistance genes

                <li>
                    When human pathogens like Staphylococcus aureus (which causes skin and respiratory infections), mix
                    with these environmental bacteria, they borrow these genes freely, making them potential killers

                <li>
                    India’s first concrete move to tackle the problem was the 2017 National Action Plan for
                    Antimicrobial Resistance, which talks about imposing limits on antibiotics in industrial waste. But

                    If India wants to move ahead with its target of all-electric vehicles by 2030, and also wants to
                    truly help the environment while doing so, then it will need much more renewable energy than the 175
                    GW target set for 2022, according to Purpose Climate Lab, a global campaign group focused on climate

                    Unless the renewable energy target is significantly increased, the target of an entire fleet of

                The concept of electric transportation, especially public transportation, is a really good one because
                it will reduce India’s imports of foreign oil, which is great, since those billions of dollars can then

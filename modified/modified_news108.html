                    Japan’s new concept-
                    <strong>
                        “Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy”:

                    China and North Korea.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Strategy aims to create a “free and open” Asia-Pacific region which connects parts of eastern
                    Africa, south Asia and southeast Asia with the western Pacific Ocean region and Japan.

                <li>
                    The ‘Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy’ rests on “two oceans” — Indian and Pacific — and “two

                    </strong>
                    by connecting “two oceans” and “two continents”, Japan is quietly challenging China’s aggressive
                    plans in the South China Sea that pose a threat to the energy lane that sustains Japanese economy.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    In a study conducted by the European Commission, it is found that the time taken for export and
                    import activities is among the highest in Africa (excluding the northern region)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Moreover, the documents required to export and import are also on the higher side in Africa

                <li>
                    However, achieving the desired level of trade facilitation is a challenging task for Africa and Asia

            <ul>
                <li>
                    India has already made efforts through various initiatives to develop capabilities in other
                    countries in Asia and Africa in the past
                </li>
                <li>

                <li>
                    But we can re-energize such projects/initiatives through AAGC funding that could lead to promotion
                    of imports and exports
                </li>
                <li>
                    India must evolve appropriate strategy to meet import and export requirements of partner countries

                    Reasons for low level growth in Africa:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The low level of private investment in Africa is withholding high growth
                </li>
                <li>
                    Owing to risky projects on long gestation projects, there has been lukewarm response from investors
                </li>
                <li>
                    Possible Solution: Private investors may be attracted by using limited state funding using the
                    European Investment Fund (EIF) Model
                </li>
                <li>
                    The EIF consists of subsidizing investment, loss protection, capital relief, reduced interest rate,
                    low collateral requirements, lease and guarantee

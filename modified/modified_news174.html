                        Accountability and Reforms and advocate Kamini Jaiswal in the Supreme Court in the medical
                        college bribery case.

                        debarred private medical college.

                    <li>
                        Responding to Justice Mishra’s remarks that the petitions were scurrilous, Mr. Prashant Bhushan
                        submitted that the petitions do not name the CJI at all.

                        The purpose of the petitions was to protect the independence of the highest judiciary as the

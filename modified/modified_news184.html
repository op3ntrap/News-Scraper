                    The Home Ministry has proposed an increase in the number of seats in the Sikkim Assembly from 32 to
                    40. The expansion will be the first since the State merged with India in 1975.

                    The seats are being increased to accommodate people from the

                </li>
                <li>
                    As per the Delimitation Act, 2002, the number of seats in an Assembly of any State can only be
                    readjusted on the basis of the first census conducted after 2026.

                    The final order made by the Delimitation Commission could not have been challenged by any court but

                    The decision comes after Opposition members in the Rajya Sabha managed to clear amendments to the

                        Key Fact:
                    </strong>
                    The NCBC, a statutory body created in 1993, was given limited powers: to recommend inclusion in or
                    exclusion of a community from the Central list.

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The power to hear complaints of the OBCs and protect their interests remained with the National
                    Commission for Scheduled Castes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Since the National Commission for Scheduled Castes deals with the grievances and safeguards of the
                    SCs as well as the OBCs, it has limited capacity to address the needs of the OBCs.

                    A group of Union Ministers including Home Minister discussed at length a draft law to put an end to
                    instantaneous ‘triple talaq’, a Muslim way of divorce, which is said to be still in practice despite
                    the Supreme Court striking it down.

                </li>
                <li>
                    The Ministers also discussed whether a new legislation should be brought or the existing penal
                    provisions be suitably amended to make it an offence.
                </li>
                <li>
                    According to the law, a victim of ‘talaq-e-biddat or instant triple talaq, would have no option but
                    to approach the police for redressal of her grievances, as a Muslim clergy would be of no assistance
                    to her.

                    Talks held recently at the level of officials between the U.S., Japan, Australia and India (the
                    Quadrilateral) are seen as an indication of this

                    Latent concerns about Chinese expansionism have not prevented several Asian nations from endorsing

                <li>

                    In Asia, India, Japan and, to an extent, Vietnam appear willing to endorse the U.S. initiative to

                    India has lately taken up issues well beyond South Asia, such as North Korea and China’s actions in

                    This puts it in direct confrontation with China, as also in opposing China’s ambitions in the Indian

                    As the outlines of a new bipolarity in Asia become clearer, and with the formal setting up of the
                    Quadrilateral, China is certain to regard all this as an attempt to encircle it
                </li>
                <li>
                    This will pave the way for a new round of turmoil as China might use both force and inducements to

                    President Ram Nath Kovind gave his assent to the ordinance approved by the Union Cabinet to amend

                </li>
                <li>
                    The ordinance aims at putting in place safeguards by prohibiting wilful defaulters, those associated
                    with non-performing assets (NPAs), and the habitually non-compliant, from regaining control of the
                    defaulting company or stressed assets through the back door in the garb of being a ‘resolution

                    The amendments also provide for fine ranging from Rs. 1 lakh to Rs. 2 crore for those violating
                    these norms.

                <li>
                    The ordinance aims at putting in place safeguards to prevent unscrupulous, undesirable persons from

                <li>
                    The amendment also provides such check by specifying that the Committee of Creditors (CoC) should
                    ensure the viability and feasibility of the resolution plan before approving it.

                        <li>
                            In doing so, the government hoped to promote cultivation of bamboo in non-forest areas to
                            achieve the “twin objectives” of increasing the income of farmers and also increasing the
                            green cover of the country.

                        <li>
                            This will now create a viable option for cultivation in 12.6 million hectares of cultivable
                            waste land.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It will encourage farmers and other individuals to take up plantation/block plantation of
                            suitable bamboo species on degraded land, in addition to plantation on agricultural land and
                            other private lands under the agro-forestry mission
                        </li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    Bamboo grown in the forest areas would continue to be governed by the provisions of the Indian
                    Forest Act.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For several years now, the classification of the bamboo — with its multifarious uses as an edible
                    item, furniture and construction — as a tree meant that it couldn’t be easily ferried across State
                    borders. It also required permits from village councils and couldn’t be cultivated in non-forest
                    areas.

                <li>
                    Country has 19% share of the world’s area under bamboo cultivation, its market share in the sector
                    is only 6%.

                    The panel for revision of wages under the
                    <strong>
                        Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA)
                    </strong>
                    has recommended that there is no need to ensure parity with minimum wages paid by various states
                </li>
                <li>
                    It states that wages under the rural employment guarantee scheme were last aligned to minimum wages
                    in 2009, and that “there is no compelling reason to align MGNREGA and states minimum wages again”.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The panel had earlier found that MGNREGA wages were lower than the minimum agricultural wages paid
                    in 17 states and Union Territories
                </li>
                <li>
                    In 2014, a seven-member expert committee, headed by Professor Mahendra Dev, had held that MGNREGA
                    workers should be paid at least the minimum wages paid to agricultural workers in the states, if not
                    more, to meet basic needs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The report, was accepted by MoRD but rejected by the Finance Ministry citing the fiscal burden
                    involved.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The ministry panel has agreed to the 2nd recommendation of the Mahendra Dev committee, that the
                    Consumer Price Index for Rural (CPI-R), which reflects the present consumption pattern, should be
                    the basis for annual revision of MGNREGA wage rates, and not CPI- Agricultural Labourers (CPI-AL),
                    which is based on the consumption pattern of 1983

                    There has been a divergence because several states have arbitrarily increased their minimum wages
                    without following any scientific principles.

                    Union government had claimed that this year’s MGNREGA budget of Rs 48,000 crore is the highest ever
                </li>
                <li>
                    But the wage revision this year was at a mere 2.7 percent, the lowest in the scheme’s ten-year
                    legacy leading to a mere Rs 1-3 per day hike in several states.

                    The MGNREGA wages are far lower than minimum wages in states such as Karnataka, Punjab, West Bengal,

                                    The purpose of the IGF is to maximize the opportunity for open and inclusive
                                    dialogue and the exchange of ideas on Internet governance (IG) related issues;
                                    create opportunities to share best practices and experiences; identify emerging
                                    issues and bring them to the attention of the relevant bodies and the general
                                    public; contribute to capacity building for Internet governance.

                                    The main aim of the IGF is to facilitate inclusive, productive discussions on
                                    Internet related public policy issues from a general perspective, while keeping all
                                    stakeholders involved. This includes having a harmonized and consistent approach
                                    when covering IG issues. To further this aim, the IGF adheres to the generally used
                                    UN principle of discouraging ad hominem attacks. As such, participants should
                                    refrain from singling out individual persons, companies, countries or entities
                                    during their interventions and throughout the general discussions and debates in
                                    main sessions, workshops and other events at IGF meetings. Concrete examples can be
                                    highlighted in the overall coverage of IG issues as long as it is not done in a
                                    blatantly inflammatory or potentially libelous way. Singling out one entity without
                                    broader context could not only discourage further participation of this entity, but
                                    endanger inclusive and productive discussion at the IGF.

                    Context:

                demonetisation was failure because RBI’s annual report showed that 98.96% of the demonetised currency
                had returned to the central bank.

                    noteswould cease to be legal tender.

                    The notes hoarded by anti-national and anti-social elements will become just worthless pieces of

                </li>
                <li>
                    This demonetised money would not be tendered back into the banking system due to fear of punitive

                    Finance Minister to now claim that the “confiscation of money” had not been an objective, and the
                    government had expected all the SBNs [specified bank notes] to come back to the banking system to
                    become effectively usable currency

                    Despite the large amounts that were deposited in banks post-demonetisation, it is doubtful whether

                    In an area like Australia, differences in ocean temperatures are likely to change around 10-20
                    degrees throughout the year; however, species in Antarctica have evolved in an environment where
                    there is very little variation in temperature. It’s certainly a concern, when the temperature
                    changes just by one or two degree Celsius here in the Antarctic region.

                Question 1.
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            As a DM of a home district of serving Chief Minister, you find out that a huge land scam has taken place in
            which close relatives of the Chief Minister are involved. The scam which you have unearthed has caused lots
            of financial loss to the state’s exchequer. You have been recently married to a daughter of an MLA who is
            known as staunch political enemy of the CM.
        </p>
        <p>
            While you are investigating the matter for further proofs, before you make this issue public, the CM comes
            to know about this. He threatens you with dire consequences if you do not close the file and bury the matter
            silently. He threatens you with false criminal cases and CBI investigation in case you do not budge.
            Unfortunately, a case is pending against you regarding misuse of treasury funds, in which you haven’t done
            anything wrong. This case can be reopened and used against you. However, if you stop investigation, he has
            assured you that you will be given a plum post in the capital.
        </p>
        <p>
            Identify which course of action are available to you. Examine each action’s merits and demerits. Finally,
            explain which course of action would you follow and why?
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>

            <li>

            <li>

                father-in-law.
            </li>
            <li>
                Report the matter in media anonymously.

                Lot of personal hardship caused in the process including false CBI inquiry.

            <li>
                Putting life and family in jeopardy.

        </ol>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Course of action to be followed:
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            I would choose option 2. Investigation would be carried out as usual. Meanwhile
        </p>
        <p>
            CM should be told politely but firmly that I am performing my constitutionally mandated duties and I have no
            option to Go.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is a possibility that CM’s party workers would spread message that MLA is playing vendetta politics
            through his in-law. So sound proofs before the public are necessary to avoid any backfire.
        </p>
        <p>
            If CM, in the meanwhile starts any CBI investigation on my any past acts, I would welcome that as I have not
            done anything wrong. Even Government suspends, I would cooperate with the enquiry to prove my innocence. If
            necessary I would move to court for protection against harassment.
        </p>
        <p>
            But in no case, I would close the file to avoid any personal hardship to my career and my family as it would
            amount to compromising on my values and ethics which civil service holds.

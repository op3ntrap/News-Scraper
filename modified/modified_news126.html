        <div id="A neutral Internet">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The struggle to keep the Internet freely accessible to all got a welcome shot in the arm.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) finally came out with clear guidelines in favour of
                    Net neutrality that are consistent with its earlier stand on Facebook’s Free Basics proposal.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After consultation papers issued in May 2016 and this January, the regulator reiterated that there
                    cannot be discriminatory treatment of websites on the Internet by service providers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In particular, TRAI warned providers against the practice of blocking certain websites and tinkering
                    with content speeds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This, in a nutshell, means that service providers such as telecom companies cannot stand in the way
                    of a consumer’s access to content that would otherwise be provided to her without any undue
                    hindrance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    They cannot, for instance, charge consumers for access to certain content, or receive payment from
                    websites promising greater promotion of their product over the rest.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Quite notably, TRAI’s decision comes in the wake of international focus on the U.S. Federal
                    Communications Commission’s decision to scrap regulations on service providers imposed during the
                    Obama administration.
                </li>
                <li>
                    While batting for the right to an open Internet, however, TRAI has been careful to allow some
                    exceptions that allow companies to discriminate between content if it helps them regulate the flow
                    of traffic or offer “specialised services”.
                </li>
                <li>
                    While TRAI’s new guidelines will help the cause of building the Internet as a public platform with
                    open access to all, the concerns of service providers should not be dismissed altogether.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Internet has spread all over the world, so widely that many believe it is now an essential good.
                    But the infrastructure that serves as the backbone of the Internet has not come without huge
                    investments by private service providers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    So any regulation that severely restricts the ability of companies to earn sufficient returns on
                    investment will only come at the cost of the welfare of the public.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In this connection, TRAI has been open to adopting a nuanced view that differentiates between
                    various forms of content instead of imposing a blanket ban on all forms of price differentiation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The new policy, for instance, will still allow companies to justify the costs incurred in providing
                    niche content to consumers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    At the same time, TRAI’s measured response is likely to effectively address the problem of
                    anti-competitive practices adopted by certain providers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Interestingly, it has left it, with important caveats, to the government to decide on services that
                    count as “specialised” and deserve exceptional treatment by regulators.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To this end, a proper mechanism needs to be instituted to make sure that the exceptions are not used
                    as loopholes by the big Internet players.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Policymakers will also need to think hard about creating an appropriate legal framework to prevent
                    the capture of regulation by special interests.

        The road to an open Internet

        <div id="The road to">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Net neutrality creates rules of the road for a free and open Internet. It requires that barriers
                    should not be created by telecom and Internet service providers for user choice by limiting their
                    power to discriminate between content providers and different classes of content.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Through binding rules and regulations, the power of access providers to selectively price or create
                    technical imbalances is corrected. Such an argument immediately appeals to our sense of fairness,
                    for it based on maintaining a level of equality in the use of a common resource.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This finds express acknowledgement in the precedent of the Supreme Court where it has stated that
                    the power to license spectrum and telegraphs is held by the government as a trustee of public
                    interest.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In one of the more recent judgments which arose from a presidential reference on the allocation of
                    natural resources, the Supreme Court observed that, “
                    <em>
                        <u>
                            as natural resources are public goods, the doctrine of equality, which emerges from concepts
                            of justice and fairness, must guide the state in determining the actual mechanism for
                            distribution of material resources.
                        </u>
                    </em>
                    ”
                </li>
                <li>
                    Taking this forward, TRAI in its recommendations on Net neutrality has suggested amendments to the
                    various classes of telecom and Internet licences to have an express recognition of
                    <em>
                        <u>
                            a non-discriminatory principle for Internet content.
                        </u>
                    </em>
                    Such recommendations set a broad rule with tailored exceptions that are conditioned on touchstones
                    of reasonableness.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Beyond equality and reasonableness, which may seem evocative though fuzzy principles, a more
                    tangible appreciation of Net neutrality is immediately felt on our liberty.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Internet today affords millions of Indians with an immediate audience without the traditional
                    costs of distribution.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tinkering with its character, or carving it up in slices as would happen in the absence of Net
                    neutrality, would fragment its community and the diversity of choice offered by it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This would impact both the right to speak and the ability to receive knowledge, hence impacting our
                    right to freedom of speech and expression.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Again, such realisation is found in the Differential Pricing Regulation issued on February 8, 2016,
                    which prevented telecom companies from pricing access to Internet websites and content differently.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the explanatory memorandum to this regulation, TRAI states, “As observed by the Supreme Court,
                    allowing citizens the benefit of plurality of views and a range of opinions on all public issues is
                    an essential component of the right to free speech. This includes the right to express oneself as
                    well as the right to receive.”
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    <u>
                        Constitutional guarantees
                    </u>
                </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The concepts of equality, reasonableness and liberty which underpin the social contract which gives
                    rise to the Indian Constitution are not mere black letters of the law.
                </li>
                <li>
                    They are more than mere limitations on state power in favour of individuals. By themselves, they are
                    at their very best when they are put into motion by positive actions by regulators and governments.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To achieve these objectives, there is a necessity to popularise the constitutional doctrine in ways
                    and methods which seem immediate and cater to the daily problems of the modern world.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The debates around Net neutrality in India have shown how a stand-up comedy video can spark a
                    spontaneous campaign, spur more than a million people to send e-mails to a telecom regulation
                    consultation when the stakes are clearly explained and there is a broad coalition of civil society
                    voices.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Net neutrality campaign has not been without criticism and growing public disappointment. While
                    such sentiments may arise from legitimate concerns, they are disproportionate to the greater benefit
                    of raising public debate.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To restrict any public policy measure, especially something as important as Net neutrality, to a
                    restricted group of experts without a chance of public engagement betrays elitism.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Further, the repeated rounds of public consultation which have brought on some amount of fatigue are
                    due to the inherent complexity of the regulatory exercise.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This also provides us a lesson that the enjoyment of Net neutrality will require constant, hard work
                    — no victories are permanent.
                </li>
                <li>
                    But for a moment we can pause to celebrate how TRAI’s recommendations on Net neutrality provide hope
                    that modern technologies can refresh constitutional doctrine and also deepen participatory
                    democracy.

        TRAI backs free data in a non-discriminatory way

        </p>
        <div id="TRAI backs">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has stuck to its recommendation of allowing free
                    data to consumers in a non-discriminatory manner by third-party aggregators while agreeing with the
                    telecom department’s views that government money can be used for connectivity rather than supporting
                    free data scheme to rural subscribers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The regulator noted that data had become affordable due to a tariff war in the telecom sector, and
                    that “concern with regard to availability of affordable data services has been mitigated.”
                </li>
                <li>
                    The authority tends to agree with the views of DoT (Department of Telecom) that a larger focus is
                    required on connectivity, content availability in local language and digital literacy. The resources
                    could therefore be effectively utilised to address the said issues.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In December last year, Trai had recommended that a “reasonable” amount of free data access — say a
                    100 MB per month — be provided to rural subscribers and the scheme could be funded from the
                    Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF).
                </li>
                <li>
                    However, the DoT subsequently pointed out that cost of an Internet enabled mobile handset was a
                    bigger “obstacle” than the tariff of Internet access, and that the latter had already been addressed
                    to an extent through market competition.
                </li>
                <li>
                    DoT questioned whether it would be worthwhile to provide a subsidy to those rural subscribers who
                    already owned smartphones. It opined that the applicability of the proposed scheme was “limited”,
                    thus undermining its tenability.
                </li>

                    The transgender community and its allies have erupted in anger over the decision of the Ministry of
                    Social Justice and Empowerment to re-introduce the original Transgender Persons (Protection of
                    Rights) Bill, 2016 in the winter session of Parliament.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Journey of the Bill
                </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The transgender community saw the Supreme Court’s landmark decision in NALSA v. Union of India as a
                    victory, as it recognised that transgender persons have fundamental rights.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The judgment was followed by a private member’s Bill, the Rights of Transgender Persons Bill, 2014,
                    which was unanimously passed in the Rajya Sabha.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Instead of introducing it in the Lok Sabha, the Ministry uploaded its own Bill, the Rights of
                    Transgender Persons Bill, 2015, on its website in December for public comments.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The 2015 Bill, which was largely based on the 2014 Bill, did away with the national and State
                    commissions for transgender persons and transgender rights courts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Bill was fairly progressive since it granted a transgender person the right to be identified as
                    a ‘man’, ’woman’ or ‘transgender’.
                </li>
                <li>
                    However, the 2016 Bill, that was finally introduced in the Lok Sabha, came as a shock.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A highly diluted version, it also pathologised transgender persons by defining them as “partly
                    female or male; or a combination of female and male; or neither female nor male”.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Met with backlash, the Ministry set up an expert standing committee on social justice and
                    empowerment to examine the Bill.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    The committee report
                </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The standing committee invited public comments and thereafter held multiple rounds of consultations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Its report criticised the 2016 Bill for its stark deficiencies and recommended re-drafting the
                    definition of a ‘transgender person’ to make it inclusive and accurate; providing for the definition
                    of discrimination and setting up a grievance redress mechanism to address cases of discrimination;
                    and granting reservations to transgender persons.
                </li>
                <li>
                    However, its substance lay in its insistence that the law must grant equal civil rights to
                    transgender persons (marriage, divorce and adoption), thus opening the door for the legal system to
                    take steps to undo its oppressive heteronormative (the presumption that heterosexuality is the norm)
                    and cisgendered (the presumption that people’s gender identity is aligned with their anatomical sex)
                    foundation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Ministry’s decision to re-introduce the 2016 Bill disregards the pre-legislative consultative
                    policy which requires Ministries to grant a minimum of 30 days for public comments and to place a
                    summary of feedback/comments received from the public/other stakeholders on their website.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Enacting a law prohibiting torture is both a moral imperative and a pragmatic necessity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Union government has informed the Supreme Court that it is seriously considering the 273rd
                    Report of the Law Commission, which has recommended that India ratify the United Nations Convention
                    against Torture and pass a law to prevent torture and punish its perpetrators.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A few months ago, the court had sought the Centre’s response to a petition filed in public interest
                    by former Union Law Minister Ashwani Kumar, who complained about the delay in India ratifying the UN
                    Convention, which it had signed in 1997.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The petition had also favoured a standalone legislation to prohibit torture. The court disposed of
                    the matter without any direction after being informed that the matter was under serious
                    consideration.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Centre should now act on its own with a sense of urgency. There can be no reason to further
                    delay legislative measures to eliminate all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading
                    forms of treatment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    At an earlier hearing, the court had itself highlighted why a standalone law is needed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    India has made many requests for extradition of offenders from other countries, and the absence of
                    an anti-torture law may prevent these countries from acceding to India’s requests.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Earlier this month, extradition courts in the United Kingdom refused to send two persons to India to
                    face trial, one of them on the ground that there was “no effective system of protection from torture
                    in the receiving state”.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Conditions in India’s prisons, especially the chronic problem of over-crowding, are a reason for the
                    country’s extradition requests failing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Few would disagree that ratifying the UN Convention and following it up with a domestic law against
                    torture will not only be in the national interest but also have positive implications for the
                    protection of human rights.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Custodial violence continues to be prevalent in the country. The recent example of a bus conductor
                    being forced to confess to murdering a schoolchild is a pointer to the use of torture as an
                    investigative tool among policemen.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Prevention of Torture Bill was passed by the Lok Sabha in 2010 to address the problem, but it
                    lapsed after it was referred to a Select Committee in the Rajya Sabha.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Law Commission, to which the question was referred in July this year, produced a report within
                    three months. It also submitted a draft Bill for the government’s consideration.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The government should accept the recommendations without delay as it not only provides a penal
                    framework for punishing public servants who inflict torture, but also lays down that just
                    compensation be paid to victims.

                    The Supreme Court said it did not intend to frame guidelines for the police regarding registration
                    of FIRs on subjecting a married woman to cruelty for dowry, as the process had to be governed by
                    statutory provisions.

                <li>
                    The top court was hearing pleas filed by NGOs Social Action Forum and ‘Nyayadhar’ alleging that such
                    guidelines had created roadblocks in the registration of FIRs and the penal provision be allowed to

                    An estimated one in 10 medical products circulating in low- and middle-income countries like India
                    is either “substandard or falsified”, says a new research report from the World Health Organisation

                <li>

                    A key impediment to eliminating malaria is a weak surveillance system.India and Nigeria, two major
                    contributors to the global burden of malaria, were able to detect only 8% and 16% of cases
                    respectively via the system.

                    <em>

                </li>
                <li>
                    India — due to low funding per person at risk and resistance to certain frontline insecticides — is
                    only expected to achieve a 20%-40% reduction.

                    In 2016, an estimated Rs. 13,000 crore was invested in malaria control and elimination efforts
                    globally by governments of malaria endemic countries and their international partners.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The majority (74%) of investments in 2016 was spent in the WHO’s Africa region, followed by the WHO
                    regions of Southeast Asia (7%), the Eastern Mediterranean and the Americas (each 6%), and the
                    Western Pacific (4%).

                <li>
                    “India has reduced its new malaria cases by one third, and even crossed the malaria mortality
                    targets of 2020,” said Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare J.P. Nadda at a high-level round
                    table on ‘Accelerating the Elimination of Malaria in the Southeast Asia Region’.
                </li>
                <li>
                    He further added that with nearly three-fourths of the share of the regional burden, India’s
                    successes had significantly contributed to the reduction of the burden of malaria for the entire
                    Southeast Asia region.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Union Minister noted that a majority of malaria cases in the country occurred in its bordering
                    districts, forests and tribal areas.

                    Early this year, the Indian Navy permanently deployed a frontline warship at the mouth of the strait
                    to keep an eye on the increasing Chinese movements in the Indian Ocean as part of its mission-based
                    deployment.

                    The comments assume significance as the strait is considered a critical choke point for global

                    Well ahead of the Brexit referendum last year, politicians across the political spectrum in Britain
                    highlighted the importance of dealing with the impact that leaving the European Union (EU) would
                    have on the island of Ireland.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a joint effort shortly before the referendum, former Prime Ministers Tony Blair and John Major
                    came together to warn that the stability of Northern Ireland and the long-fought-for peace was at
                    stake.

                <li>
                    The Troubles — the period of deep civil and political unrest in Northern Ireland, from the 1960s to
                    the 1990s that pitted largely Protestant Unionists against largely Catholic separatists — are in the
                    past, thanks to rapprochement that culminated in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, though the
                    political situation remains sensitive.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Membership of the EU has played a significant role in maintaining that environment with strong
                    economic ties between Northern Ireland and the EU state of Ireland, as well as close personal links.
                    Over 35,000 people cross the border between the two each day, while 1,77,000 lorries and 1.85
                    million cars cross each month.

                    With Britain set to leave the EU — and the single market and customs union — the future relationship
                    between Ireland and Northern Ireland was always going to present a challenge.

                    Unsurprisingly, the issue was put forward as the priority area from Europe along with resolving the
                    issue of citizen’s rights (those of EU citizens in Britain and vice-versa) and the so-called divorce
                    bill.

                    However, while progress has been made on the other issues, including Britain stepping up its offer
                    of what it is willing to pay the bloc, the Irish question remains as intractable as ever, with the
                    intensity of the debate heating up over the past month.

                    Last week, Irish Taoiseach (or Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar issued a strong ultimatum to Britain,
                    insisting that Ireland needed written assurances that there would be no hard border — including no
                    physical infrastructure on the border — in Ireland before Brexit negotiations with the remaining 27
                    member states could move to the so-called second phase, when the crucial future shape of the trade
                    relationship is to be discussed.

                <li>
                    Some sections of the British media have highlighted divisions within Europe, suggesting, for
                    example, that German Chancellor Angela Merkel was pushing a tough line, and that the uncertainty
                    over her political future could be to Britain’s advantage.

                <li>
                    Europe, however, has maintained a remarkably unified line on Brexit, including on issues relating to
                    individual nations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All signs point to this being the case on Ireland too, including comments by Irish Foreign Minister
                    Simon Coveney who this week pointed out that Ireland would not have to exercise a veto to block a
                    Brexit deal if its concerns about Brexit were not addressed, because other EU nations were committed
                    to standing by it.

                    political sensitivity around the Irish question.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As one spokesperson for the Irish government highlighted this week, failure to resolve the issue
                    could lead to a resurgence of violence, and warned that there was a true threat of paramilitary
                    action should a controlled border be reinstated.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The controversy comes amid yet further blows to Britain. Last week Australia, a country with which a
                    free trade deal was touted as one aspect of the bright future that awaited Brexit Britain, expressed
                    strong objections to plans to share quotas for low-tariff food imports currently imposed by the EU
                    between Britain and the EU.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This would disadvantage the country by placing greater restrictions on what could be exported.
                </li>
                <li>
                    India too has been stepping up on the importance it places on the freer movement of professionals in
                    any negotiations on a future trading agreement, a highly political sensitive issue in Britain.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The issues highlight one of the problems at the heart of Brexit: while the Leave side has from the
                    outset sought to position the process as a U.K.-centric one of taking back control, it has proved
                    anything but that with the collective and individual concerns of other member-states taking
                    centrestage.

                    The Centre is mulling a new approach that institutionalises the combined strengths of its ‘Make In
                    India’ (MII) and ‘Invest India’ initiatives with an aim to streamline them for attracting more
                    investments, including from overseas, in the manufacturing sector.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The MII was unveiled in September 2014 to “transform India into a global design and manufacturing
                    hub” while ‘Invest India’ is the government’s investment promotion and facilitation agency.

                    The government was also trying to improve the Start-up India policy by studying why only 74
                    start-ups had qualified for tax benefits since the policy was unveiled in January 2016.

                    Over the next 15 years, however, Indian driving is likely to be disrupted by electric vehicles that
                    the Indian government seems keen on introducing, without transitioning to hybrids.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Far less polluting and carbon-emitting, the electric car, however, poses a challenge to Indian
                    driving practices. The motor is much quieter than the engine and the transmission system has fewer
                    parts too.

                    Another crucial, efficiency-boosting attribute of the electric car will be regenerative braking. The
                    electric motor powering the car can reverse its role, becoming a generator and charging the battery.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The generator load is the resistance that provides braking torque and it can be varied if you want
                    to just bring down the speed, not stop the car altogether.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Electric cars present a unique opportunity for Indian drivers. Instead of tamping down the
                    technology, we can instead change our habits — be mindful of lanes, wait our turn, be polite and
                    respectful of others and their needs, and make our driving smoother, as well as make best use of
                    regenerative braking.

                    Air pollution can increase the risk of asthma in adults, even at low levels, a study has warned.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Researchers found that Australians aged 45-50 who lived less than 200 metres from a major road had a
                    50 per cent higher risk of asthma, wheeze and lower lung function over a five-year period than those
                    who lived more than 200 metres from a major road.
                </li>
                <li>
                    They noted that the increase in these health issues was despite
                    <em>
                        <u>
                            Australia’s relatively low safe nitrogen dioxide (
                        </u>
                        NO2)
                    </em>
                    limit of 30 parts per billion per year. Australia has relatively low air pollution levels compared
                    with developing South East Asian countries.
                </li>
                <li>
                    However, the study found that even these are associated with increased risk of asthma and poor lung
                    function in adults. Governments need to investigate ways of reducing emissions on these roads,
                    particularly trucks using diesel.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Diesel is much more harmful than petrol because of the composition of the fuel. When it burns,
                    diesel produces more pollutants.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The study found the rapidly increasing prevalence of asthma after the second half of the 20th
                    century strongly suggested environmental exposures played a major role.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In particular, the role of traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) exposures in exacerbating or causing
                    asthma has attracted substantial interest.

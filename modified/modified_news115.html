                                UPA-I government in May 2008, it also provides that one third of the total number of
                                seats reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes shall be reserved for women of
                                those groups. Similar Bills have been introduced thrice before in the late 90’s but
                                lapsed with the dissolution of their respective Lok Sabhas.

                        Key Issues and Analysis
                    </strong>

                    <li>
                        There are divergent views on the reservation policy. Proponents stress the necessity of
                        affirmative action to improve the condition of women. Some recent studies on panchayats have
                        shown the positive effect of reservation on empowerment of women and on allocation of resources.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Opponents argue that it would perpetuate the unequal status of women since they would not be
                        perceived to be competing on merit. They also contend that this policy diverts attention from
                        the larger issues of electoral reform such as criminalisation of politics and inner party
                        democracy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Reservation of seats in Parliament restricts choice of voters to women candidates. Therefore,
                        some experts have suggested alternate methods such as reservation in political parties and dual
                        member constituencies.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Rotation of reserved constituencies in every election may reduce the incentive for an MP to work
                        for his constituency as he may be ineligible to seek re-election from that constituency.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The report examining the 1996 women’s reservation Bill recommended that reservation be provided
                        for women of Other Backward Classes (OBCs) once the Constitution was amended to allow for
                        reservation for OBCs. It also recommended that reservation be extended to the Rajya Sabha and
                        the Legislative Councils. Neither of these recommendations has been incorporated in the Bill.

                        The issue today is how the U.S. strategy differs from the past in terms of addressing concerns
                        regarding Pakistan’s role in Afghanistan, particularly in view of a shift in Pakistan’s
                        strategic priority towards China.

                        Present Situation in Afghanistan continues to be fragile, though Taliban has made some gains but
                        at the same it is not a cohesive movement and has several divisions in it.

                        On January 4, 1950, India signed a Treaty of Friendship with Afghanistan which also permitted
                        opening of consulates in each other’s country.

                        India’s assistance to Afghanistan amounts to $2 billion and it covers broad spectrum of areas
                        like  political, security, trade and economic cooperation and capacity development.

                    <li>
                        India has always wanted a democratic, stable and strong Afghanistan able to decide its own
                        future and it supports its quest for reconciliation.

                    <li>
                        Various surveys show that the Afghan people ranked Indian assistance as the most suitable
                        because of the positive role India played in the development programme of Afghanistan and they
                        appreciate that India has never interfered in their internal affairs.

                        India can assist Afghanistan in training and supplying them much-needed spare parts.

                        It is essential to take action against terrorism and insurgency and treating Taliban’s Quetta

                        Unfair attempts have been made to link the Afghan issue with India-Pakistan relations. There is

                        Pakistan-Afghanistan relations since 1947 have always been thorny and replete with problems
                        except during the brief Taliban era.

                        India and Afghanistan have never exploited their friendly bilateral relations to harm Pakistan.
                        This is clear from-

                    <li>
                        In both the 1965 and 1971 wars, Afghanistan was non-committal and did not support India.

                    <li>
                        On the Kashmir issue, Afghanistan has not publicly supported India.

                        Neither India nor India-Pakistan relations were responsible for the situation which prevailed in
                        Afghanistan following the departure of the Soviet troops.

                    <li>
                        The U.S. operation to kill Osama bin Laden and the recourse to drone attacks in Afghanistan were
                        due to the situation prevailing there, which had nothing to do with India or India-Pakistan

                        five-judge Constitution Bench
                    </strong>

                    The decision to set up a five-judge Bench comes despite Justice Rohinton Nariman’s separate judgment
                    in the nine-judge Bench declaring
                    <strong>

                    The nine-judge Bench of the Supreme Court came out with the historic judgment in favour of the

                <li>
                    The nine-judge Bench verdict has a crucial bearing in the Aadhaar petitions, which have argued that

            <p>
                The commission has come to the conclusion that the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 and the Indian Evidence
                Act, 1872 require amendments to accommodate provisions regarding compensation and burden of proof,
                respectively.

                In order to curb the menace of torture and to have a deterrent effects on acts of torture , the

                account various facets of an individual case, such as nature, purpose, extent and manner of injury,
                including mental agony caused to the victim. The Courts will bear in mind the socio-economic background
                of the victim and will ensure that the compensation so decided will suffice the victim to bear the
                expenses on medical treatment and rehabilitation.

                treatment.

                    Main Reason behind the issue:

                Insensitive bureaucracy.

            <p>
                <strong>
                    Evolution of bureaucracy:
                </strong>
                Our society runs on paperwork
                <strong>
                    .
                </strong>
                Bureaucracy came into being after the birth of scripts in ancient civilization
                <strong>
                    .
                </strong>
                When a large amount of administrative data was created, a system was needed to retrieve the stored
                knowledge
                <strong>
                    .
                </strong>
                And this gave rise to archiving, cataloguing and classifying. More than writing, it was this method of
                retrieval that led to efficiency
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    People’s connection with bureaucracy:
                </strong>
                Bureaucracy is new in developing countries.
            </p>
            <p>
                And we must realise that institutionally, people are not “bureaucracy-receptive”
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Bureaucracy and India:
                </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Indian villager accesses the state through a local leader.Everyone knows everyone else and
                    independent bureaucracy cannot be executed in the web of interdependent informal relationships among
                    the stakeholders
                </li>
                <li>
                    When the state creates a new bureaucratic framework that trumps local networks (on which informal
                    societies such as India are built), citizens become confused and find themselves at a loss to
                    negotiate their space

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Societies carry a historical burden of norms and customs
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mostly informal in nature, these institutions cannot be changed overnight

                <li>
                    New laws and regulations introduced in any society must recognise the informal social norms society
                    is predicated upon
                </li>
                <li>
                    In societies such as India, citizen-state interaction is historically built on patronage and
                    personal relations; bureaucratic forms of engagement are recent
                </li>
                <li>
                    Western societies that are individualised, are prepared to function bureaucratically, and can
                    successfully build independent regulatory bodies
                </li>
                <li>
                    But collectivist societies like India cannot, and may be should not, try this

            <ul>
                <li>
                    In diverse societies, bureaucracies have to be contextual, and therefore emotional
                </li>
                <li>
                    They must be designed for everyone, and not just for the urban elites
                </li>
                <li>
                    Regulations force people to change their behaviour and dynamics instantly
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the bureaucracy is not empathetic to those who are slow in responding, it will be hugely damaging
                    to society as a whole

                    Recently, the Supreme Court decided to make public, on the court’s website, its various decisions,
                    including its verdicts on persons nominated for elevation as judges to the high courts, its choices

                </li>

                <li>
                    In 1977, in Sankalchand Sheth’s case, when interpreting the word “consultation,” the Supreme Court
                    ruled that the term can never mean “concurrence”. Hence, the CJI’s opinion, the court ruled, was not
                    binding on the executive
                </li>
                <li>
                    And in 1981, in the First Judges Case, the court once again endorsed this interpretation, partly
                </li>
                <li>
                    But twelve years later, in the Second Judges Case, the court overruled its earlier decisions. It now
                    held that “consultation” really meant “concurrence”. And that the CJI’s view enjoys primacy, since
                    he is “best equipped to know and assess the worth” of candidates
                </li>
                <li>
                    In 1998, in the Third Judges Case, the court clarified its position further. The collegium, it said,
                    will comprise, in the case of appointments to the SC, the CJI and his four senior-most colleagues.

            <ul>

                    </strong>

                    <strong>
                        National Judicial Appointments Commission
                    </strong>
                    , the court swiftly struck it down
                </li>
                <li>
                    It ruled, in what we might now call the

                    </strong>
                    (2015), that the primacy of the collegium was a part of the Constitution’s basic structure and this
                    power could not, therefore, be removed even through a constitutional amendment

                    India’s domestic budget for fighting tuberculosis showed a dramatic jump from about ₹700 crore in

                    In 2016, India recorded a 12% dip in the number of TB deaths from the previous year though the

                    2015). Inspite of the dip, India accounts for about 32% of the number of people worldwide who

                    The Union government is working to conclude the sale of national carrier Air India by June 2018 and

                    The trend has caught the attention of the capital market regulator, which is evaluating whether such
                    instruments and offerings can be brought under its regulatory purview.

                    is mulling whether an ICO can be regulated under the existing legal framework or certain amendments
                    would be required in case the government wants the capital market watchdog to be the regulatory
                    authority for such issuances.

                    Discussions have been held between various bodies, including SEBI and the Reserve Bank of India
                    (RBI), on the possible ways in which this segment can be regulated.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The central bank is of the view that these instruments are securities and so SEBI should be the
                    regulating body.

                    An ICO, like an equity initial public offer (IPO), is an issuance of digital tokens that can be
                    converted into crypto currencies and are mostly used to raise funds by start-up firms dealing in
                    blockchain technology and virtual currencies like bitcoins and ethereum.

                    What is ‘Fiscal Deficit’?

            <ul>
                <li>
                    A fiscal deficit occurs when a government’s total expenditures exceed the revenue that it generates,
                    excluding money from borrowings. Deficit differs from debt, which is an accumulation of yearly
                    deficits.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A fiscal deficit is regarded by some as a positive economic event. For example, economist John
                    Maynard Keynes believed that deficits help countries climb out of economic recession. On the other
                    hand, fiscal conservatives feel that governments should avoid deficits in favor of a balanced budget
                    policy.

                        <pre><strong>Basic Information:



</strong>Countries trade with one another to buy goods not produced in domestic economy. With the 

advent of globalization, investment to and fro have also increased many fold. A country’s 

trade and other economic exchanges with the world are recorded on its external account in 

the form of balance of payment (BoP) transactions. 



There are two components of BoP

1. Current Account

2. Capital Account



<strong>Current Account</strong> – It deals with current, ongoing, short term transactions like

trade in goods, services (invisible) etc. It reflects the nation’s net income.



For instance, if you a buy a laptop from US, it will be a current account transaction 

and it will be debit on current account as you have to pay to US.



There are 4 components of Current Account-

1. Goods – trade in goods

2. Services (invisible) – trade in services eg. tourism

3. Income – investment income

4. Current unilateral transfers – donations, gifts, grants, remittances



Note that grants might appear as component of capital account but are included 

in current account as they are unilateral, create no liability. Recipient does 

not have to give anything back in return.



<strong>Capital Account</strong> – It deal with capital transactions i.e. those transactions which

create assets or liabilities. It reflects the net changes in the ownership of 

national assets.



For instance, if you buy a stocks or property in US, it will be a capital account

transaction and it will be debit on capital account as you have to pay to US to buy

the asset.<strong> 



</strong><strong>Components of Capital Account

</strong>Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)

Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI)

External Borrowings such as ECB

Reserve Account with the Central Bank



Note here that foreign investment is under capital account but dividends and 

income from investment comes under current account in the category income from 

abroad as dividend is transferred periodically, does not result in creation of 

asset or liability.



<span>Balance of Payment (BoP) = Current Account + Capital Account = 0



</span><strong>Why?

</strong>Current Account and Capital Account always balance each other because a country 

always has to pay for its imports. It does so by exports or other two components

of current account. If it cannot, it runs deficit on current account and has to 

pay off by drawing off on its assets i.e. running capital account surplus.



<strong>What is Current Account Deficit?

</strong>It’s simply deficit on all 4 components of current account.

(Export – Import) + Net income from abroad + Net Transfers

(Export – Import) is trade deficit

CAD = Trade Deficit + Net Income From Abroad + Net transfers



Note that Trade Deficit and CAD are not one and the same. Trade deficit is only 

a component of CAD.



<strong>What does deficit on Current Account imply?

</strong>If we forget income and transfers for a moment, what it means is that we import 

more than what we export.



<strong>How do we pay for that extra import?

</strong>Either we get more foreign investment (FDI &amp; FII) and pay via that or we borrow from 

foreign banks (ECB) or we will have to dip into our external reserves to pay for that

Amount and in the process our forex reserves come down. When forex reserves come down 

below a critical level, country appears on the brink of BoP crisis.



<strong>So, is CAD such a bad thing?

</strong>Depends on what you do with those extra imports and how you finance the deficit!



<strong>CAD is bad because –

</strong>If a CAD is financed through borrowing, it is unsustainable because borrowing 

lead to high interest payments in the future

Attracting capital flows (hot money, FII) to finance the deficit is risky as when 

confidence falls, hot money flows dry up, leading to a rapid devaluation and crisis

of confidence. Eg. East Asian Crisis

Run a CAD necessarily means running a surplus on the capital account. This means 

foreigners have an increasing claim on your assets, which they could redeem any time.



<strong>However a current account deficit is not necessarily harmful

</strong>CAD during a period of inward investment particularly stable long term FDI may 

not be a bad things as investment can create jobs. Investments will lead to 

higher growth will be able to pay debts back.

Developing countries may use CAD to buy Capital goods and later export consumer 

goods and thus repay the debt

Moderate current account deficit (2% of GDP) financed mainly by stable foreign 

investments which creates jobs and infrastructure in the economy can be helpful 

in the long run as it improves productivity.<strong> 



</strong><strong>What is this twin deficit?

</strong>Current Account Deficit and Fiscal Deficit together are knows as twin deficits 

and often both reinforce each other i.e. High fiscal deficit leads to higher CAD

and vice versa.</pre>

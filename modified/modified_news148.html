                        The government in Rajasthan has
                        <strong>
                            promulgated an ordinance
                        </strong>
                        providing for prior sanction for investigation against public servants, judges and magistrates
                        for acts done
                        <strong>

                        The ordinance has virtually shielded public servants from police investigations

                    <li>
                        It gone a step ahead by restraining the public and the media from disclosing the identity of
                        government officials until the sanction to proceed with the probe is obtained.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The sanctioning authority may take up to six months for taking a decision.

                        of the Criminal Procedure Code, the ordinance lays down that if the sanctioning authority does
                        not take a decision within six months, the prosecution sanction would be deemed to have been
                        issued.

                        to be granted, will be punished with two years’ imprisonment and fine, according to Section 5 of
                        the ordinance.

                        According to the opposition this ordinance will protect criminal and corrupt officials.

                    <li>
                        It would create a cover for wrongdoing by government officials and encourage others to indulge
                        in corruption.

                    <li>

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The ordinance is an attempt to silence the media and prevent the judiciary from exercising its
                        function of setting the criminal law in motion.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code and Indian Penal Code brought through the
                        ordinance went against the
                        <strong>
                            Supreme Court’s ruling in Lalita Kumari’s case
                        </strong>
                        , 2014. The judgment had dealt with both cognisable and non-cognisable offences committed by
                        public servants. The apex court’s Constitution Bench had held that an FIR has to be lodged and
                        investigation initiated by the police officer on the complaint about a cognisable offence. In
                        the cases of non-cognisable offences, the investigating officer is empowered to initiate a
                        preliminary enquiry and seek the court’s direction to obtain sanction for prosecution.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The amendments, were superfluous and unnecessary as Section 197 of Cr.P.C. already provides
                        protection to public servants by making it mandatory for a court to take cognisance against them
                        after getting the government’s sanction. Instead of cognisance, the amendment refers to the word
                        “investigate”.

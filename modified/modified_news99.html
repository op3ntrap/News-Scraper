                    protected by India’s Constitution. The verdict resulted in the decriminalization of homosexual acts

                        <li>
                            The Supreme Court in the said case held that in order to prevent abuse of its process and to
                            cure gross miscarriage of justice, it may reconsider its judgements in exercise of its
                            inherent powers.

                            For this purpose the Court has devised what has been termed as a “curative” petition. In the
                            Curative petition, the petitioner is required to aver specifically that the grounds
                            mentioned therein had been taken in the review petition filed earlier and that it was
                            dismissed by circulation. This has to be certified by a senior advocate. The Curative
                            petition is then circulated to the three senior most judges and the judges who delivered the
                            impugned judgement, if available. No time limit is given for filing Curative petition.

                        To entertain the curative petitions, the court has laid down certain specific condition:

                        <li>
                            The petitioner will have to establish that there was a genuine violation of principles of
                            natural justice and fear of the bias of the judge and judgement that adversely affected him.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The petition shall state specifically that the grounds mentioned had been taken in the
                            review petition and that it was dismissed by circulation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The curative petition must accompany certification by a senior lawyer relating to the
                            fulfillment of the above requirements.

                        <li>
                            The petition is to be sent to the three senior most judges and judges of the bench who
                            passed the judgement affecting the petition, if available.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the majority of the judges on the above bench agree that the matter needs hearing, then
                            it would be sent to the same bench (as far as possible).

                        <li>
                            The court could impose “exemplary costs” to the petitioner if his plea lacks merit.

                    A 1,300-km undersea pipeline from Iran, avoiding Pakistani waters, can bring natural gas from the
                    Persian Gulf to India at rates less than the price of LNG available in the spot market.

                    Natural gas imported through the more than $4-billion pipeline would cost $5-5.50 per million
                    British thermal unit at the Indian coast, cheaper than the rate at which some of the domestic fields
                    supply gas.

                    Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, imported through ships costs about $7.50 per million British thermal
                    unit.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The cost of landed gas through an undersea pipeline will be at least $2 cheaper than importing LNG,
                    saving about $1 billion annually.

                <li>
                    The pipeline is planned to carry 31.5 million standard cubic meters gas per day. The pipeline can

                    Concerns regarding a build-up of resistance to antiviral drugs used to treat swine flu are
                    surfacing, after two such drugs — Oseltamivir and Zanamivir — were taken off the restrictive
                    Schedule X of the Drugs and Comestics Rules.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now under Schedule H1, the drugs can be stocked by all chemists.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Central health authorities have also advised doctors to prescribe the drugs based on strong
                    symptoms, without opting for the swab test. Medical experts say these decisions could lead to misuse
                    and eventually, severe drug resistance.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Oseltamivir and Zanamivir are antiviral drugs that block the actions of influenza virus types A and
                    B in the body. While Oseltamivir is available as tablets, Zanamivir comes in powder form.

                    We are already witnessing antibiotic resistance and related hazards.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Resistance built up only because antibiotics were easily available and even sold over the counter.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now, it seems to be going the same way with antiviral drugs.

                <li>
                    It is good, because when H1N1 cases are on the rise, the drug will be available to patients easily.
                </li>
                <li>
                    However, it could backfire because in India, we don’t use caution.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The doctors will prescribe these drugs so widely that eventually it will stop working.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Drugs under Schedule X require three copies of prescription for the doctor, patient and chemist, and
                    can be sold by a chemist who holds a special Schedule X licence.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Also, the chemist has to preserve the prescription copy for up to three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In Schedule H1, only one copy of the prescription is required, and drugs in this category can be
                    sold by all chemists.
                </li>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Chemists will still need a prescription to sell the drug. The only difference is, the drug will be
                    widely available. It all depends on doctors now. If they prescribe the drug with caution, there
                    won’t be misuse.

                    Two major Indian conglomerates have bid for supplying key equipment for the strategic Chabahar Port
                    in Iran, while the process is on to expand financial eligibility criteria to attract more bidders.

                    India is keen on expediting work on this port, located in the Sistan-Baluchistan province on the
                    energy-rich Persian Gulf nation’s southern coast that can be easily accessed from India’s West
                    coast, bypassing Pakistan.

                    The Army is ready for the long haul in holding onto its position in the Dokalam area near the Bhutan
                    tri-junction, notwithstanding China ratcheting up rhetoric against India, demanding pulling back of
                    its troops.

                    Both the countries had agreed to a mechanism in 2012 to resolve border flare-ups through
                    consultations at various levels.

                <li>
                    The mechanism has not worked so far in the current case as the standoff near the Bhutan trijunction,
                    triggered by China’s attempt to build a road in the strategically important area, has dragged on for
                    over three weeks.

                    New Delhi has already conveyed to Beijing that such an action would represent a significant change
                    of status quo with “serious” security implications for India. The road link could give China a major
                    military advantage over India.

                    Doka La is the Indian name for the region which Bhutan recognises as Dokalam, while China claims it
                    as part of its Donglang region.

                <li>
                    China and Bhutan are engaged in talks. India argues that since it is a tri-junction involving the
                    three countries, it also has a say in the issue.

                        (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act a petition for dissolution of marriage by a decree of
                        divorce may be presented to the district court by both the parties to a marriage together,
                        whether such marriage was solemnised before or after the commencement of the Marriage Laws
                        (Amendment) Act, 1976 (68 of 1976)*, on the ground that they have been living separately for a
                        period of one year or more, that they have not been able to live together and that they have
                        mutually agreed that the marriage should be dissolved.

                    <p>
                        (2) On the motion of both the parties made not earlier than six months after the date of the
                        presentation of the petition referred to in sub-section (1) and not later than eighteen months
                        after the said date, if the petition is not withdrawn in the meantime, the court shall, on being
                        satisfied, after hearing the parties and after making such inquiry as it thinks fit, that a
                        marriage has been solemnised and that the averments in the petition are true, pass a decree of
                        divorce declaring the marriage to be dissolved with effect from the date of the decree.]

                    <p>
                        (i) The period of 6 to 18 months provided in section 13B is a period of interregnum which is
                        intended to give time and opportunity to the parties to reflect on their move. In this
                        transitional period the parties or either of them may have second thoughts;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (ii) The period of living separately for one year must be immediately preceding the presentation
                        of petition. The expression living separately’ connotes not living like husband and wife. It
                        has no reference to the place of living. The parties may live under the same roof and yet they
                        may not be living as husband and wife. The parties should have no desire to perform marital
                        obligations;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (iii) The period of six to eighteen months time is given in divorce by mutual consent as to give
                        time and opportunity to the parties to reflect on their move and seek advice from relations and
                        friends. Mutual consent should continue till the divorce decree is passed. The court should be
                        satisfied about the bona fides and consent of the parties. If there is no consent at the time of
                        enquiry the court gets no jurisdiction to make a decree for divorce. If the court is held to
                        have the power to make a decree solely based on the initial petition, it negates the whole idea
                        of mutuality. There can be unilateral withdrawal of consent. Held, that since consent of the
                        wife was obtained by fraud and wife was not willing to consent, there could be unilateral
                        withdrawal, of consent.

                    Whether this phenomenon, coupled with the mercurial rise in the assets of politicians just within a
                    span of five years between two successive elections, was a product of
                    <strong>

                    India’s industrial production recovered to grow only mildly as growth in manufacturing output
                    remained flat with introduction of goods and services tax (GST) which continued to disrupt
                    production networks while retail inflation quickened in August ruling out any rate cut by the
                    central bank in the near future.

                    Rhinos, Swamp deer, Barking deer and Hog deer and Asiatic Wild Water Buffalo are not found in

                    There are 356 species of birds, the most spectacular being raptors, or birds of prey, that occupy
                    the highest canopies of the forest. Osprey, Brahminy Kite and White-Bellied Sea Eagle are dominant,

                    There are 11 turtles, including the famous Olive Ridley and Hawskbill sea turtles and the most

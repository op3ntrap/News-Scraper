                    The government is considering the introduction of a regulatory regime for virtual or crypto

                    The idea is to treat such currency in a manner similar to gold sold digitally, so that it can be
                    traded on registered exchanges in a bid to “promote” a formal tax base, while keeping a tab on their
                    use for illegal activities such as money laundering, terror funding and drug trafficking.

                Crypto-currency is a digital currency which allows transacting parties to remain anonymous while
                conforming that the transaction is a valid one. It is not owned or controlled by any institution –
                government or private.

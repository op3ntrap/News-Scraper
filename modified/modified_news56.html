                    The above observation is a shift from the dominant judicial conception of women as victims who would

                </li>
                <li>
                    The bench ruled that all such complaints received by the police or the magistrate must be referred
                    to the family welfare committee and no action should be taken against the husband and the in-laws
                    till the committee gave its report after interacting with the parties.

                    living abroad should be avoided and personal appearance of husband’s family members should not be
                    insisted upon by trial courts in dowry harassment cases.

                Since 2010, the US has supported India’s membership in the four multilateral export control regimes —

                Since 2008, the US and India have concluded more than USD 15 billion in defence trade, including the
                transfer from the US to India of C-130J and C-17 transport aircraft, P-8I maritime patrol aircraft,
                Harpoon missiles, Apache and Chinook helicopters, and M777 light-weight Howitzers.

                India operates the second largest C-17 and P-8 fleets in the world, recently using its C-17s to deliver

                The US had designated India a “Major Defence Partner” in June 2016 intending to elevate defence trade

        <ul>
            <li>
                In February, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority slashed prices of stents by up to 85 per cent
            </li>
            <li>
                Thousands of patients who couldn’t afford stents can now afford the devices at a fraction of the cost

            <strong>
                What are Stents?
            </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Stents are tiny metal tubes coated with medication, which are inserted into clogged arteries to keep
                them flowing well.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Emergency angioplasty is the treatment of choice during an acute heart attack, wherein the clot is
                crushed with a balloon and a stent is placed.
            </li>
            <li>
                It improves the chance of the patient surviving by almost 30 per cent when compared to clot dissolving
                medication (thrombolysis).
            </li>
            <li>
                However, in India, emergency angioplasty was carried out in less than 10 per cent of patients because of
                the cost involved in the procedure and the lack of access to stents.

                Preference for stenting even in cases when it is not the best treatment and disturbing increase in
                multi-vessel stenting.
            </li>
            <li>
                With cheaper stents and a fall in procedure costs, many more patients are opting for angioplasty.
            </li>
            <li>
                Patients with multiple blocks in all three vessels, open heart surgery is a better than the use of
                multiple stents. However, with lower stent prices, patients often choose multi-vessel angioplasty as it
                is cheaper than open heart surgery

                Even the latest drug-eluting stents get clogged in about 5 per cent of cases.
            </li>
            <li>
                With the increasing use of the tiny metal tubes, the chances of a stent blocking with consequent damage

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Stent manufacturers typically spend millions of dollars on research before they can make the device and
                commercialise it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Abruptly reducing stent prices will have adverse effects on the development of improved stents.

            <li>
                International companies may be able to offset their losses with profits in other markets, and from
                profits from other products
            </li>
            <li>
                Even before the price control move was instituted, only 40 per cent of the stents used in the country
                were indigenously manufactured; the rest were imported.
            </li>
            <li>
                With prices of imported stents and Indian stents now being the same, doctors and patients could prefer
                the imported devices
            </li>
            <li>
                All these will have a bearing on their capacity to do quality research.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lack of government funding for clinical research in India only aggravates the issue.

                With time, paradoxically, patients who were the intended benefactors of this price control measure may

                Encourage and support Indian stent manufacturers and medical device research so that we do no need to
                depend on imported stents.
            </li>
            <li>
                All aspects involving medical device development (clinical research, animal testing, and human trials)
                must be fast-tracked and should be as transparent as possible.
            </li>
            <li>
                There must be a system to make sure that the latest medical devices, including stents, are priced

            </li>
            <li>
                Once such a level of competency is achieved, India could actually export stents, making “Make in India”

                However, states will be able to provide for higher minimum wage in their jurisdiction than fixed by the
                central government
            </li>
            <li>
                The new minimum wage norms would be applicable for all workers irrespective of their pay.
            </li>
            <li>
                At present, the minimum wages fixed by the Centre and states are applicable to workers getting up to Rs
                18,000 pay monthly.
            </li>
            <li>
                This would ensure a universal minimum wage for all industries and workers, including those getting
                monthly pay higher than Rs 18,000

                It has recommended that the existing labour laws should be broadly grouped into four or five labour

                <li>
                    Do you consider the practice of dowry as unethical and immoral? Justify your answer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You are a no-nonsense, honest officer. You have been transferred to a remote district to head a
                    department that is notorious for its inefficiency and callousness. You find that the main cause of
                    the poor state of affairs is the indiscipline of a section of employees. They do not work themselves
                    and also disrupt the working of others. You first warned the troublemakers to mend their ways or
                    else face disciplinary action. When the warning had little effect, you issued a show cause notice to
                    the ringleaders. As a retaliatory measure, these troublemakers instigated a woman employee amongst
                    them to file a complaint of sexual harassment against you with the Women’s Commission. The
                    Commission promptly seeks your explanation. The matter is also publicized in the media to embarrass
                    you further. Some of the options to handle this situation could be as follows:
                </li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Give your explanation to the Commission and go soft on the disciplinary action.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ignore the Commission and proceed firmly with the disciplinary action.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Brief your higher-ups, seek directions from them and act accordingly.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Suggest any other possible option(s). Evaluate all of them and suggest the best course of action, giving
                your reasons for it.

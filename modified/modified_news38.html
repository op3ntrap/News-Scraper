                    </strong>
                    released a draft law of the
                    <strong>

                <li>
                    The NCAML was launched last month. The move comes in the wake of alleged government indifference to
                    mob killings in different parts of the country.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The draft law includes a definition of ‘mob’ and ‘lynching’, suggests that lynching be made a
                    non-bailable offence, recommends immediate suspension of the SHO of the area until a time-bound
                    judicial probe takes place and mandates life imprisonment for the for those convicted under mob
                    lynching.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The draft also has India-specific provisions stating how mobs are created, with technology being
                    used for rumour-mongering.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It states that a peaceful protest against leaders, policies etc. cannot be termed as a mob.

                <li>
                    Under the draft law, videographic evidence of survivors statements would also act as evidence.

                <li>
                    It also has provisions for a time-bound judicial enquiry, which should not take more than six

                    The chairpersons of backward classes commissions of southern States resolved to urge the Centre
                    against “interfering with the acts of inclusion into or exclusion from the list of socially backward

                    The Bill that seeks to give constitution status to the NCSEBC, they argued, had provisions that were

                <li>
                    conducted by the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) to identify ‘out-of-school’ children across Karnataka
                    ahead of the 2017–18 academic year.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Nearly 63% of children who dropped out of school prior to the commencement of this academic year are
                    between the ages of 11 and 13, indicating that most leave the education system after completing
                    lower primary classes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The SSA identified 7,807 children between the ages of seven and 13 who had dropped out before the
                    start of the academic year. Another 511 are children who never enrolled in school. This brings the
                    total number of children in the State who have either dropped out of school or not enrolled in one
                    to 8,318.
                </li>
                <li>
                    About 49% of the 7,807 children are those belonging to the Schedule Castes and Schedule Tribes
                    category; 48.9% are from minority communities and other backward classes. The maximum number of
                    out-of-school children are from Bengaluru Urban (1,739), followed by Kalaburagi (1,389). Vijayapura
                    district has the best record, reporting only seven such children.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The fact that children are not completing their education has been in focus since April 2013 after
                    the High Court took suo motu cognisance of the issue.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Last year, the Education Department identified 9,468 out-of-school children.

                    The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) was established in July 1989 by a Group of Seven (G-7) Summit
                    in Paris, initially to examine and develop measures to combat money laundering.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In October 2001, the FATF expanded its mandate to incorporate efforts to combat terrorist financing,
                    in addition to money laundering.

                    <strong>
                        The objectives of the FATF are to set standards and promote effective implementation of legal,
                        regulatory and operational measures for combating money laundering, terrorist financing and
                        other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system.

                    The FATF is therefore a “policy-making body” which works to generate the necessary political will to
                    bring about national legislative and regulatory reforms in these areas.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The FATF monitors the progress of its members in implementing necessary measures, reviews money
                    laundering and terrorist financing techniques and counter-measures, and promotes the adoption and
                    implementation of appropriate measures globally.

                    It is unclear whether the loan waivers would be funded through issuance of State Development Loans
                    (SDL) or other modes of financing, such as loans from banks to the state governments or bonds issued
                    by the latter to the banks
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the funding of the announced waivers of Rs 88,170 crore is done entirely through SDL in FY2018
                    (which is unlikely), the issuance of fresh SDL could rise to Rs 5,30,000 crore in FY18

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The rise in SDL issuance would firm up their yields and widen their spread relative to Central
                    Government securities (G-sec) to above 100 bps during second half of FY2018
                </li>
                <li>
                    The expected increase in SDL issuance is likely to contribute to crowding out the private sector
                    from accessing the bond markets at competitive rates

                    Uttar Pradesh would have to curtail its budgeted capital expenditure by more than 70 per cent to

                <li>
                    Maharashtra state government may lack the space to raise borrowings to fund the entire loan waiver
                    of Rs 34,000 crore in FY18, which may be on account of other spending that is not fully budgeted

                    State Development Loans (SDLs) are dated securities issued by states for meeting their market
                    borrowings requirements. In effect, the SDL are similar to the dated securities issued by the
                    central government.

                    Purpose of issuing State Development Loans is to meet the budgetary needs of state governments. Each
                    state can borrow upto a set limit through State Development Loans.

                    GMOs carry risks of ‘unintended’ effects and toxicity and long term,health impacts such as cancer.

                <li>
                    GMOs are self-replicating organisms and genetic contamination of the environment, of non-GM crops

                    Glyphosate is one of the most widely used herbicides in the United States and considered the safest

                    Glyphosate is an endocrine (hormone) disruptor.

                <li>
                    But no regulatory agency regulates for endocrine disruption despite evidences from Argentina that it

                    Bayer’s glufosinate, the herbicide linked with Indian HT mustard, is an acknowledged neurotoxin
                    banned in the EU.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Supreme Court-appointed technical expert committee recommended a ban on any HT crop in India
                </li>
                <li>
                    The myths with GM crop technology that it “will feed the world” — are fast dissolving.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The current GMOs, Bt cotton and HT on empirical evidence are proven unsustainable technologies.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There are promises of GMOs with traits for disease, drought etc, but these are complex, multi-gene
                    traits and remain futuristic.

                <li>
                    We have moved from dismal regulation in Bt cotton in 2002 to outright delinquency in commercialising
                    HT mustard.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The regulation is subterranean, unconstitutional and also in contempt of Supreme Court orders

                Context:
            </strong>
            Last year, the SC scrapped licences for liquor sale along highways.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Reason:
            </strong>
            that drunken driving was the main culprit for the large number of road accidents in the country.

                Punjab has become the first State to take the amendment route to make way for liquor sale near highways
                as the Assembly passed a legislation enabling hotels, restaurants and clubs to serve alcohol within 500
                metres of highways.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Bill stated that it aims to ensure that hotels, restaurants, clubs and other notified places are
                allowed to serve alcohol to customers only for consumption within their premises to secure the
                livelihood of a large segment of population.
            </li>
            <li>
                However, sale of liquor for takeaway purposes shall be permitted only through licensed vends which shall
                not be located within 500 metres from the outer range of the National or State Highway or a service lane
                of those roads

            <strong>
                Context:
            </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                There has been a rising trend of farm loan waivers in country in recent times and after UP, Maharashtra
                and Punjab, Karnataka has also announced waivers for few categories of farmers.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>
                What do farm loan waivers leads to?
            </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Farm loan waiver undermines an honest credit culture, it impacts credit discipline, it blunts incentives
                for future borrowers to repay
            </li>
            <li>
                Waivers engender moral hazard.
            </li>
            <li>
                It also entails at the end of the day, transfer from taxpayers to borrowers
            </li>
            <li>
                On account of this, overall government borrowing goes up and yields on government bonds also are
                impacted
            </li>
            <li>
                It can also lead to the crowding out of private borrowers as higher government borrowing can lead to an
                increase in cost of borrowing for others
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Present demands and reasons behind them:
            </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The present demands are an outcome of the fact that the government is willing to provide for “acts of
                God”, not for “acts of state”
            </li>
            <li>
                The policy framework for farm loans has a provision that when the Centre declares a drought, farm loans
                in officially designated “affected districts” are rolled over, initially for a year, up to a maximum of
                three years
            </li>
            <li>
                Farmers’ problems in 2016-17 are almost entirely the outcome of demonetisation: there was no clear
                geographical demarcation, and there has been no rolling over of loans
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>
                What if farm loans are not waived?
            </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Agricultural loans by banks in India are compulsorily insured by the Agricultural Insurance Company of
                India (AIC)
            </li>
            <li>
                Its liabilities are back-stopped by the Centre through budgetary support
            </li>
            <li>
                Even if loans aren’t waived, there is no loss to banks
            </li>
            <li>
                In situations of widespread and acute farmer distress leading to substantial defaults, the Centre will
                have to step in and provide funds
            </li>
            <li>
                The difference is that waivers are borne by states, and defaults are borne by the Centre
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>
                How this all started?
            </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                To improve farmer livelihoods and check food inflation, our agricultural strategy has been based upon
                persuading farmers to move away from traditional subsistence agriculture towards more commercial
                operations
            </li>
            <li>
                This entails farmers investing much more and taking higher risks
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Economic consequences:
            </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Traditional farm finance sources like moneylenders can neither provide the requisite volume of funds nor
                do they allow enough margins to make risk-taking worthwhile
            </li>
            <li>
                Forcing farmers back to moneylenders will retard diversification, thereby increasing the risk of
                accelerating food inflation
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>
                The ‘sub-sovereign’ dilemma:
            </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                At the heart of this problem are constitutional provisions
            </li>
            <li>
                Health of the banks is the Centre’s concern while the health of the farmers is that of the states
                (Center, state and concurrent lists)
            </li>
            <li>
                This division of responsibility is asymmetric in that if states protect the interest of farmers, they
                also protect banks; while the Centre can protect banks without concern for farmers
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Possible solutions:
            </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The Centre and states need to work together to evolve a farm loan model which protects both farmers and
                banks without bringing politics into it
            </li>
            <li>
                This is the essence of “cooperative federalism”
            </li>

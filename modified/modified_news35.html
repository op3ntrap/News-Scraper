                    The Law Commission of India- the commission headed by former Supreme Court judge Justice B.S.
                    Chauhan, has recommended compulsory registration of marriages.

            <p>
                <strong>

                    The lack of provisions for compulsory registration of marriages had proven disastrous for women and
                    deprived them of societal recognition and legal security.

                </strong>
                Fraudulent marriages are on the rise especially among non-resident Indians. Compulsory registration can
                serve as a means to ensure that conditions of a valid marriage have been performed.

                    </strong>
                    , including a provision for compulsory registration of marriage, would serve the purpose.

                    pathogen, that is, making extra copies of its nucleic acids.

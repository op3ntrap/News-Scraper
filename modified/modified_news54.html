                            The song Vande Mataram, composed in Sanskrit by Bankimchandra Chatterjee, was a source of
                            inspiration to the people in their struggle for freedom. It has an equal status with
                            Jana-gana-mana. The first political occasion when it was sung was the 1896 session of the
                            Indian National Congress.

                            </strong>
                            This act makes provision that whoever burns, mutilates, destroys, disfigures or otherwise
                            shows disrespect to India’s National Flag or Constitution shall be punished with an
                            imprisonment (max-3 years) or a fine or both. The definition of Indian Flag included any
                            picture, drawing, photograph or any other visible representation.

                            </strong>
                            Display of National Flag is governed by the provisions of two acts viz. Emblems and Names
                            (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950 and Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act,
                            1971. Further, the government also issues non-statutory instructions from time to time. The
                            Flag Code of India brings these laws, conventions and other instructions together and serves
                            as a single reference point about how to properly hoist flag of India with due honour. The
                            Flag Code of India itself is not an act of parliament.

                            </strong>
                            Disrespect to national insignia has been linked to Section 124(A) of IPC, which refers to
                            sedition. This section was slapped on few people in Kerala who failed to stand while
                            National Anthem was being played in a theatre. Similarly, a youth was arrested under Section
                            66-A of the IT Act in 2014 {this section is now null and void} for posting a picture of
                            National Flag with a derogatory comment on it on Facebook.

                            The section 3 of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act says that whoever
                            intentionally prevents the singing of National Anthem or causes any disturbance in such

                </li>
                <li>
                    This triggered protests and claims of ‘linguistic imperialism’ in the Darjeeling and Kalimpong

                <li>
                    Subsequent protests and crackdowns have led to further destruction and deaths.

                    The Gorkhaland movement is a long-standing quest for a separate State of Gorkhaland within India for
                    Nepali-speaking Indian citizens (often known as ‘Gorkhas’).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Gorkhaland is a classic sub-nationalist movement, similar to those that have produced other States
                    like Telangana, Uttarakhand etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Gorkhaland is a desire for the recognition, respect, and integration of Gorkha peoples in the Indian
                    nation-state.

                    The movement is neither separatist nor anti-nationalist; it is about inclusion and belonging in
                    India.

                    It stands as a key means to redress the Gorkhas’ enduring history of discrimination, misconception,
                    and marginalisation in India.
                </li>
                <li>
                    By demanding Gorkhaland, the people of Darjeeling-Kalimpong are opting out of West Bengal’s
                    domination, and opting in to the democratic frameworks of India.

                    Gorkhas face discrimination when they seek education and work in places like Kolkata, Bengaluru, and
                    New Delhi. Called ‘foreigners’, ‘outsiders’ and ‘chinkys’, racial discrimination affects aspiring
                    Gorkhas at every turn.

                    Reasons for resurgence
                </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Since 1947, the Darjeeling-Kalimpong region has remained under West Bengal, despite no substantive
                    pre-Partition evidence to support West Bengal’s territorial claims to this region.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Conciliatory set-ups like the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (1988-2012) and the GTA (2012-present)
                    have failed to provide meaningful autonomy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Banerjee and others stridently lay claim to Darjeeling, insisting that Bengal will never be divided.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Imposition of compulsory Bengali is an extensions of histories of domination that the Gorkhas are
                    trying to escape.
                </li>
                <li>
                    West Bengal’s recent creation of the Kalimpong district (2017) and the State’s doling out of Tribal
                    Development Boards to ethnicities within the Gorkha conglomerate (Tamang, Sherpa, etc.) might appear
                    as paving the way for the TMC’s electoral gains.
                </li>
                <li>
                    These seems clear examples of ‘divide and rule’ — causing splits in the Gorkha electorate and
                    undermining the already-limited authority of the GTA.
                </li>
                <li>
                    By summoning thousands to the streets, the GJM (Gorkha Janmukti Morcha) demonstrated its ability to
                    evoke the emotional force of Gorkhaland. But then violence took hold.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For Gorkhas, the troubling realities of colonial and present-day Darjeeling are eerily similar:
                    linguistic chauvinism, ethnic and racial discrimination, resource extraction, unilateral territorial
                    claims, the denial of self-governance, political suppression; and ultimately, an unwillingness to
                    respect the ‘native point of view’.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Due to this advisory recommendations, States can choose to ignore the council’s advice, by levying
                    additional tax not only on the sale of goods but also on services and manufacturing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On the other hand, if these recommendations are treated as obligatory, we are left with a situation
                    where States would have altogether surrendered their fiscal autonomy to the Central government.

                            The Admiralty (Jurisdiction and Settlement of Maritime Claims) Bill, 2016 was introduced in
                            Lok Sabha on November 21, 2016 by the Minister of State for Shipping, Mr. Mansukh Mandaviya.
                            The Bill seeks to consolidate the existing laws on civil matters of admiralty jurisdiction
                            of courts, admiralty proceedings on maritime claims, and arrest of ships.  Admiralty laws
                            deal with cases of accidents in navigable waters or involve contracts related to commerce on
                            such waters.  The Bill repeals laws such as the Admiralty Court Act, 1861, the Colonial
                            Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890.  Key features of the Bill include:
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            </strong>
                            The jurisdiction with respect to maritime claims under the Bill will vest with the
                            respective High Courts and will extend up to the territorial waters of their respective
                            jurisdictions.  The central government may extend the jurisdiction of these High Courts. 
                            Currently admiralty jurisdiction applies to the Bombay, Calcutta and Madras High Courts. 
                            The Bill further extend this to the High Courts of Karnataka, Gujarat, Orissa, Kerala,
                            Hyderabad, and any other High Court notified by the central government.

                            The High Courts may exercise jurisdiction on maritime claims arising out of conditions
                            including: (i) disputes regarding ownership of a vessel, (ii) disputes between co-owners of
                            a vessel regarding employment or earnings of the vessel, (iii) mortgage on a vessel, (iv)
                            construction, repair, or conversion of the vessel, (v) disputes arising out of the sale of a
                            vessel, (vi) environmental damage caused by the vessel, etc.  The Bill defines a vessel as
                            any ship, boat, or sailing vessel which may or may not be mechanically propelled.
                        </li>

                            While determining maritime claims under the specified conditions, the courts may settle any
                            outstanding accounts between parties with regard to the vessel. They may also direct that
                            the vessel or a share of it be sold.  With regard to a sale, courts may determine the title
                            to the proceeds of such sale.

                            </strong>
                            Among all claims in an admiralty proceeding, highest priority will be given to maritime
                            claims, followed by mortgages on the vessel, and all other claims.  Within maritime claims,
                            the highest priority will be given to claims for wages due with regard to employment on the
                            vessel.  This would be followed by claims with regard to loss of life or personal injury in
                            connection with the operation of the vessel.  Such claims will continue to exist even with
                            the change of ownership of the vessel.

                            </strong>
                            Courts may exercise admiralty jurisdiction against a person with regard to maritime claims. 
                            However, the courts will not entertain complaints against a person in certain cases.  These
                            include: (i) damage, or loss of life, or personal injury arising out of collision between
                            vessels that was caused in India, or (ii) non-compliance with the collision regulations of
                            the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 by a person who does not reside or carry out business in
                            India.  Further, Courts will not entertain action against a person until any case against
                            them with regard to the same incident in any court outside India has ended.

                            The courts may order for the arrest of any vessel within their jurisdiction for providing
                            security against a maritime claim which is the subject of a proceeding.  They may do so
                            under various reasons such as: (i) owner of the vessel is liable for the claim, (ii) the
                            claim is based on mortgage of the vessel, and (iii) the claim relates to ownership of the

                            transfer an admiralty proceeding at any stage from one High Court to any other High Court. 
                            The latter High Court will proceed with the matter from the stage where it stood at the time
                            of the transfer.

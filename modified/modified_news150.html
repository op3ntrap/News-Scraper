                <li>
                    A notification by the Union Environment Ministry this month has junked the 10 mg/litre target.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It says that STPs coming up after June 2019 — except in major State capitals and metropolitan cities
                    — need only conform to 30 mg/litre of BoD.
                </li>

                    These include proposed STPS to treat sewage in stretches of the river downstream of Haridwar,

                </li>
                <li>

                    Why such a move to ease the norms?
                </strong>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The 10 mg criteria was impractical and required advanced technology that was too costly for most
                    States.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), also called biological oxygen demand) is the amount of
                    <strong>
                        dissolved oxygen
                    </strong>
                    (DO) needed (i.e., demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present
                    in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The BOD value is most commonly expressed in milligrams of oxygen consumed per litre of sample during
                    5 days of incubation at 20 °C and is often used as a surrogate of the degree of organic pollution of
                    water.
                </li>
                <li>
                    BOD can be used as a gauge of the effectiveness of wastewater treatment plants.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Why is BOD important?
                </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Biochemical Oxygen Demand is an important water quality parameter because it provides an index to
                    assess the effect discharged wastewater will have on the receiving environment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The higher the BOD value, the greater the amount of organic matter or “food” available for oxygen
                    consuming bacteria.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the rate of DO consumption by bacteria exceeds the supply of DO from aquatic plants, algae
                    photosynthesis or diffusing from air, unfavourable conditions occur.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Depletion of DO causes stress on aquatic organisms, making the environment unsuitable for life.
                    Further, dramatic depletion can lead to hypoxia or anoxic environments.
                </li>
                <li>
                    BOD is also used extensively for wastewater treatment, as decomposition of organic waste by
                    microorganisms is commonly used for treatment.

                    </strong>
                    the Centre has come out with draft guidelines which stipulate existing and new industries,
                    infrastructure and mining projects have to obtain a `
                    <strong>
                        no-objection certificate’ (NOC)

                    from district and state-level authorities for drawing groundwater.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The draft guidelines exempt farmers from obtaining NOCs. It calls for medium and large farmers to
                    adopt water conservation measures.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The draft also proposes to levy a new water conservation fee based on quantum of groundwater
                    extraction in lieu of existing provision of creating recharge mechanism, including construction of

                    The proposed fee is based on water use quantity and groundwater capacity of particular area zone.

                <li>
                    The amount, therefore, varies from Rs 1 to Rs 6 per cubic metre.

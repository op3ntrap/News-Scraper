                    . As refineries worldwide seek to operate more efficiently and extract more gasoline and other high
                    value fuels from each barrel of crude oil, a solid carbon material known as petcoke is produced.

                    Petroleum coke, also called pet coke or petcoke, is a solid carbon material that resembles coal; it
                    is a product of oil refining
                </li>
                <li>
                    Petroleum coke or Pet Coke is used by industries as fuel and contains various dangerous chemicals

                <li>
                    Pet coke also has high Sulphur contents which on burning releases large amounts of Sulphates into

                </li>
                <li>

                    A petition was filed in the Supreme Court pointing out the vagueness in the procedure for removal of
                    Election Commissioners, saying it affects the panel’s autonomy.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Proviso to Article 324 (5) of the Constitution safeguards the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) from
                    arbitrary removal.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The CEC can be removed from office only by the order of the President, just like a judge of the
                    Supreme Court. However, the same constitutional provision is silent about the procedure for removal
                    of the two Election Commissioners. It only provides that they cannot be removed from office except
                    on the recommendation of the CEC.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The petition, seeks to provide Election Commissioners with the same protection against arbitrary
                    removal as the CEC.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The plea also sought direction to the Centre to provide an independent secretariat to the Election
                    Commission.

                    <strong>

                    <strong>
                        Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.

                <strong>
                    Why such a move?
                </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A study that showed that among the adoptable 48,000-odd children across child care institutions,
                    only 2,000 are linked to adoption agencies under JJ Act, half of them are children with special
                    needs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) presently has a waitlist of more than 17,000
                    prospective parents.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There cannot be two parallel systems as it makes it very difficult to check instances of child
                    trafficking.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The adoption provisions under HAMA need to be repealed so that adoptions happen only through JJ Act.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    THE HINDU ADOPTIONS AND MAINTENANCE ACT, 1956 (HAMA)
                </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    HAMA allows couples from Hindu, Buddhist, Jain and Sikh communities to adopt children of parents
                    belonging to these communities through a simple agreement.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Adoptions under HAMA are between two individuals and it is very difficult to monitor cases of
                    misuse, selling or trafficking of children.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The JJ Act states that nothing in this Act shall apply to the adoption of children made under the
                    provisions of the HAMA.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Another recent study, by CARA, showed the extent of unregistered adoptions under HAMA.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For Example-In Delhi less than 50 adoptions were officially registered in a year under HAMA, but
                    3,200 stamps were sold for the stated purpose of adoption where the deeds were simply notarised.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    What is the problem?
                </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    As per the adoption regulations of the JJ Act, all child-care institutions were to be registered
                    with CARA within six months of the legislation coming into force in January 2016.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Twenty months later, 10 per cent of the total institutions are both linked to adoption agencies and
                    registered under the Act.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The recent ministry study found that there are 9,400 child-care institutions across the country,
                    over half of which are unregistered.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The ministry will issue an ultimatum to all child-care institutions asking them to register under
                    the JJ Act by December 31, else shut down operations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This is aligned with May 2017 order by a Supreme Court bench in a case regarding exploitation of
                    children in a Tamil Nadu orphanage that held that all child-care institutions have to be registered
                    under JJ Act by the year end.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Many institutions hold on to the children as their funding agencies give them grants based on the
                    number of children with them.

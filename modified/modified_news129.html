                    <li>
                        Current government promised that 18,500 villages would receive electricity in the next 1,000
                        days.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Now nearly 14,500 of these villages have been “electrified”. But more than a fourth of the
                        households in the “electrified villages” do not have a power connection.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Saubhagya scheme, launched by the PM last week should be seen in this context.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The scheme changes the metric for measuring progress in electrification from the village to the
                        household-level.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Beneficiaries under the Saubhagya scheme would be identified using the Socio Economic and Caste
                        Census (SECC) 2011 data
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Unelectrified households not covered under the SECC 2011 would also be provided electricity
                        connections under the scheme on a payment of Rs 500, which shall be recovered by discoms in 10
                        installments through electricity bills

                    <li>
                        Free or subsidised connections will ensure last-mile connectivity, often seen as among the
                        biggest stumbling blocks to electricity access in the country.

                    <li>
                        By roping in panchayats and other village-level institutions, it ensure that Saubhagya does not
                        remain a top-down endeavour

                    <li>
                        Ensuring reliable supply requires improving the health of discoms.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The UDAY scheme, launched in 2015, has made some headway in improving the finances of the state
                        discoms

                    <li>
                        Saubhagya grants them the freedom to lower tariffs to people covered under the scheme. But at
                        the same time, UDAY makes it incumbent on the states to pay for all the future losses of discoms
                    </li>

                        The series of flood disaster across the countries appeals for a shift in the focus from flood

                        and Bhutan to Assam’s floodplains thus carrying large amounts of sediments. When these get
                        deposited reduces the river’s storage capacity along the channels. This in turn results in flood
                        along the adjoining plains.

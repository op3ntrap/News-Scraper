                        The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), also known as Mahatma
                        Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS) is Indian legislation enacted on
                        August 25, 2005. The MGNREGA provides a legal guarantee for one hundred days of employment in
                        every financial year to adult members of any rural household willing to do public work-related
                        unskilled manual work at the statutory minimum wage. The Ministry of Rural Development (MRD),
                        Govt of India is monitoring the entire implementation of this scheme in association with state
                        governments

                        This act was introduced with an aim of improving the purchasing power of the rural people,
                        primarily semi or un-skilled work to people living below poverty line in rural India. It
                        attempts to bridge the gap between the rich and poor in the country. Roughly one-third of the
                        stipulated work force must be women.

                    <li>
                        Adult members of rural households submit their name, age and address with photo to the Gram
                        Panchayat. The Gram Panchayat registers households after making enquiry and issues a job card.
                        The job card contains the details of adult member enrolled and his /her photo. Registered person
                        can submit an application for work in writing (for at least fourteen days of continuous work)

                        A Special Task Force (STF) of the police busted a State-wide network of hackers who allegedly
                        bypassed the set standards of the biometric system of the Unique Identification Authority of
                        India (UIDAI) and created fake Aadhaar cards through cloning of fingerprints.

                        with the source code of the UIDAI application client (software used by Aadhaar enrolment

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The present business model of rating agencies allow considerable room for issuers of securities
                        to shop for a favourable rating or avoid negative ratings by severing their ties with these
                        agencies.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Prudential regulation is thus justified to tackle this problem. This criticism, however, ignores
                        the reputational damage these agencies suffer after each corporate default
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        But repeated failures have not affected the business of rating agencies, primarily due to the
                        lack of alternative service providers who can help out investors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Individual creditors have thus had to trust the ratings of the existing rating agencies at their
                        own peril, even after repeated crises
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Indian credit rating market is an oligopolistic one due to the high barriers to entry.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        SEBI’s proposed move to impose further quality requirements on rating agencies is unlikely to
                        change things for the better, or raise further barriers.

                        Predicting earthquakes is impossible, but it is possible to save people living in distant cities
                        through a simple warning system, which will give them enough lead time to reach a safe open
                        place in case of an impending earthquake.

                    <li>
                        The early earthquake warning system works on the
                        <strong>
                            principle of propagation of various waves
                        </strong>
                        with different velocities starting together from the same point and reaching the target at
                        different times.

                        </strong>
                        travel much faster and will reach the target much ahead of the damaging seismic waves giving
                        what we call a lead time

                        This project in India is part of the overall research being conducted by the IIT Roorkee, in the
                        field of earthquake engineering and is an extension of the pilot project undertaken in the
                        Himalayan region.

                        IIT Roorkee was the first institute to deploy 84 sensors in seismic gap region of the
                        <strong>
                            Garhwal Himalayas in Uttarakhand

                        with the help of the Ministry of Earth Sciences.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        These on-site sensors stream data in real-time to a computer server at the institute using
                        network of the Uttarakhand government which is being processed for issuing warning for magnitude
                        6 and above earthquakes.

                        Recent data sets compiled over the last 2 centuries reveal that large magnitude earthquakes have
                        occurred around various regions of the Himalayas, but one segment of the central Himalaya, known
                        as the
                        <strong>
                            central seismic gap
                        </strong>
                        , has potential to generate a major earthquake and researchers tend to believe that such an
                        earthquake is overdue.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The seismic sources with such potential in proximity to cities like Delhi has made this region a
                        perfect case for the use of early earthquake warning system as one of the key disaster
                        mitigation strategies.

                        The Supreme Court on Friday sent a clear message to the public to not panic, by directing mobile
                        service providers and banks to specify the last dates for linking mobile numbers and bank

                        their products, and said such a procedure has major potential since fruit-juice based drinks are
                        an intrinsic part of Indian food habits.

                    India’s initial start was promising. The first cabinet meeting of Jawaharlal Nehru took a collective

                    Allowances should be in proportion to the services that they have rendered to the nation, but in the

                    It was conducted in 2013 by the Inter-Parliamentary Union across 104 Parliaments highlighted that

                <li>
                    Mature democracies typically have separate independent bodies to establish parliamentary salaries;

                    Instead of seeking pay in line with the private sector, India’s public representatives should be
                    paid a reasonable wage, which offers gratitude for their commitment to life as a public servant
                </li>
                <li>
                    Require an external, independent body to determine parliamentary salaries.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Salary reviews should be conducted through an institutionalised process

                    Carbon monoxide (CO) can have adverse effects on the health of people exposed to it. Hence, it

                    Typically, a sensor would be a thin, current carrying plate whose resistance changes on exposure to
                    carbon monoxide. This in turn changes the value of the current flowing through it. This change when
                    measured indicates the level of carbon monoxide in the air.

                    Most available sensors are in the micrometer range, a nanometer-sized detector would have a higher
                    sensitivity, but the cost of manufacturing it goes up as the size decreases.

                    The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has a vision of deploying such sensors in
                    large scale for pollution monitoring in large cities like Delhi and Bengaluru.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the sensors are installed in all traffic intersections, we can do real time mapping of pollution
                    hot-spots in a city. This would be an enabler in realizing smart cities.

                    Scientists have for the first time managed to edit genes in a human embryo to repair a genetic
                    mutation.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Scientists fixed a mutation that thickens the heart muscle, a condition called hypertrophic
                    cardiomyopathy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The cardiac disease causes sudden death in otherwise healthy young athletes and affects about one in
                    500 people overall.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is caused by a mutation in a particular gene and a child will suffer from the condition even if
                    it inherits only one copy of the mutated gene.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Correcting the mutation in the gene would not only ensure that the child is healthy but it would
                    also prevent the mutation from being passed on to future generations

                    Though the research marks a major milestone in genome editing of embryos, it will be a long while
                    before it becomes available as a tool to produce healthy embryos.

                <li>
                    Even research on embryos using federal funding is not permitted in the U.S., where the research was
                    carried out.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The embryos were produced with the clear intention of using them solely for research and not for
                    implanting them in women.

                    You are working as an Executive Engineer in the construction cell of a Municipal Corporation and are
                    presently in-charge of the construction of a flyover. There are two Junior Engineers under you who
                    have the responsibility of day-to-day inspection of the site and are reporting to you, while you are
                    finally reporting to the Chief Engineer who heads the cell. While the construction is heading
                    towards completion, the Junior Engineers have been regularly reporting that all construction is
                    taking place as per design specifications. However, in one of your surprise inspections, you have
                    noticed some serious deviations and lacunae which, in your opinion, are likely to affect the safety
                    of the flyover. Rectification of these lacunae at this stage would require a substantial amount of
                    demolition and rework which will cause a tangible loss to the contractor and will also delay
                    completion. There is a lot of public pressure on the Corporation to get this construction completed
                    because of heavy traffic congestion in the area. When you brought this matter to the notice of the
                    Chief Engineer, he advised you that in his opinion it is not a very serious lapse and may be
                    ignored. He advised for further expediting the project for completion in time. However, you are
                    convinced that this was a serious matter which might affect public safety and should not be left
                    unaddressed.

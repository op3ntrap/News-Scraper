                        The NHRC has issued notices to the governments and police chiefs of Tamil Nadu and Andhra
                        Pradesh over the alleged inhuman treatment being meted out to girls and women who are forcibly
                        taken to temples as part of an old ritual that resembles the banned Devadasi system.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The girls and women are taken to temples of Goddess Mathamma for “offering” in Thiruvallur

                    <li>
                        As a part of the ritual, the girls are dressed up as a bride and once the ceremony is over,
                        their dresses are removed by five boys, virtually leaving them naked.

                        They are denied to live with their families and have education.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In a major speech on the new administration’s policy towards South Asia, Donald Trump demanded
                        that Pakistan end its destabilisation of Afghanistan by providing safe havens to the Taliban and
                        other terror networks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Trump’s emphasis in the speech was indeed on India stepping up its economic and development
                        assistance to Afghanistan.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        India and the US are fully aware that without stronger external military support to Kabul, the
                        talk of development could become increasingly futile
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The 2011 Strategic Partnership Agreement between Delhi and Kabul explicitly called for security
                        cooperation, including the transfer of military equipment.

                    <strong>
                        Key points:
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Delhi did not want deeper security cooperation with Afghanistan that could cast a shadow over
                        its ties with Pakistan.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A second constraint has been geography. The lack of physical access has imposed substantial
                        limitations on Delhi’s military role in Afghanistan
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        US resistance to a larger Indian security footprint in Afghanistan
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The US was convinced that any Indian military role in Afghanistan would grate Pakistan’s
                        political sensitivities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        But Trump has now actively encouraging India to take greater responsibilities in Afghanistan.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Trump’s Indo-Pak inversion may or may not be sustainable over the long-term.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Many in Washington would want to go back to the default option of avoiding confrontation with
                        Pakistan in Afghanistan.

                        The 2017 kharif foodgrain output may comes down to 134.67 million tonnes (mt) from a record

                        <strong>
                            Reasons:
                        </strong>
                        Floods and erratic rainfall in different parts of the country
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The drop in output was seen across all major rain-fed crops except sugarcane
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sugarcane registered a nearly 10 per cent increase in cropping area and a corresponding increase
                        in output
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>

                    <li>
                        It may have an impact on farm incomes, which will be lower because of lower output
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This would mean that the demand for other goods in rural areas will not recover the way the
                        government was hoping it would

                    <li>
                        In other words, despite having two good monsoon in a row, private consumption expenditure will
                        not go up and thus may have an impact on the overall economy

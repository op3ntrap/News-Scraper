                                    The detection has revealed not merely a black hole merger, but also the alignment of
                                    the spins of the black holes.

                                    The spins of the individual black holes making up the merger are probably not
                                    aligned along the same direction. This supports the theory which says that black
                                    holes form independently in a star cluster, then sink to the centre of the cluster
                                    and eventually merge

                                    The new observations yields support to Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity.
                                    According to this theory, gravitational waves, unlike light waves, will not disperse
                                    as they travel through space. This too has been confirmed by the analysis of the
                                    presently detected signal.

                                    space, will place animals at ‘unprecedented’ extinction risk in the next 50 years.

                                    Safeguarding Earth’s precious creatures amid such pressures will require the
                                    expansion and better management of conservation areas, the authors argued.

                                    The ultimate drivers of hunting and poaching must be addressed, for example, by
                                    providing people with alternative livelihoods or sources of protein.

                                    Agricultural yields — the crop produced per available hectare of land — must be
                                    increased through measures that include protecting soil fertility, and using more
                                    pest- and drought-resistant seeds.

                                    Drastic change to human diets and farming methods could provide ‘healthy diets’ for
                                    10 billion people by 2060, while also preserving liveable habitats for most
                                    remaining species.

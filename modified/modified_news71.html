                    According to the committee, the government’s new system of rating officers on the basis of a
                    360-degree approach is susceptible to bias, manipulation and lacks fairness.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The 360-degree approach is a new multi–source feedback system for performance appraisal of
                    bureaucrats.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It relies on feedback of juniors and other colleagues for an all-round view, other than appraisal
                    reports written by senior officers.

                    Feedback in this process is obtained informally, making the process susceptible to being

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The logistics Data Bank Service would bring efficiency in the current Logistics &amp; Supply Chain
                    through use of information technology that would be helpful for tracking and viewing the movement of
                    containers across the port to the ICD and end users.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Every container is attached to a Radio Frequency Identification Tag (RFID) tag and then tracked
                    through RFID readers — aids importers and exporters in tracking their goods in transit.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This has, in turn, cut the overall lead time of container movement as well as reduced transaction

                <li>
                    The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) says it plans to launch a full-fledged niche Earth
                    observation (EO) satellite — called the
                    <strong>
                        Hyperspectral Imaging Satellite or HySIS
                    </strong>

                </li>
                <li>
                    ISRO is endeavouring to enter the domain of operational hyperspectral imaging from earth orbit with
                    a satellite that can see in 55 spectral or colour bands from 630 km above ground.

                    </strong>
                    It can be used for a range of activities from monitoring the environment, crops, looking for oil and
                    minerals all the way up to military surveillance — all of which need images that show a high level
                    of differentiation of the object or scene.

                    ‘Hyspex’ imaging is said to enable distinct identification of objects, materials or processes on
                    Earth by reading the spectrum for each pixel of a scene from space.

                    About a decade ago, ISRO added another EO niche with
                    <strong>
                        microwave or radar imaging satellites RISAT-1 and 2
                    </strong>
                    that could ‘see’ through clouds and the dark — an important feature useful for the military and
                    security agencies.

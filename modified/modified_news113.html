                <li>
                    The National Sample Survey (NSS) data from 2011-12 show that about 19% of the sample claims to be
                    Dalit, 9% Adivasi, and 44% OBC
                </li>
                <li>
                    Among the population aged 25-49, less than 7% have a college degree
                </li>
                <li>
                    By most estimates, less than 3% of the whole population is employed in government and public-sector

                </li>
                <li>
                    Since reservations cover only half the college seats and public-sector jobs, the mismatch is obvious
                </li>
                <li>
                    A vast proportion of the population eligible for reservations must still compete for a tiny number
                    of reserved and non-reserved category jobs
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is not surprising that there is tremendous internal competition within groups

            <ul>
                <li>
                    At the moment, the only reputable nationwide data on caste comes from the 1931 colonial Census and
                    some of the ad hoc surveys conducted for specific castes
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) of 2011 was supposed to provide up-to-date comprehensive data
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the SECC in 2015, it was found that about 4.6 million distinct caste names, including names of
                    gotra, surname and phonetic variations were returned, making the results almost impossible to
                    interpret
                </li>
                <li>
                    For nearly 80 million individuals, caste data were believed to be erroneous
                </li>
                <li>
                    Since then we have heard little about the quality of caste data in SECC and even less about its
                    results

                    Preparations for Census 2021 are ongoing
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is still time to create an expert group to evaluate the methodology for collecting caste data
                    and include it in the Census forms
                </li>
                <li>
                    Losing this opportunity would leave us hanging for another 10 years without good data for
                    undertaking sub-categorisation of OBC quota

                    Their disadvantage begins in early childhood and grows progressively at higher levels of education

                <li>
                    We know little about what goes on in schools to create these disadvantages but improving quality of

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Use of the OBC quota must be limited to once in a person’s lifetime, allowing for a churn in the
                    population benefitting from reservations
                </li>
                <li>
                    Linking the Aadhaar card to use of benefits makes it possible that individuals use their caste
                    certificates only once
                </li>
                <li>
                    It will help in spreading the benefits of reservations over a wider population

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The present move by the government to rethink OBC quota could potentially be used to ensure that we
                    have better data on caste-based disadvantages for future discourse
                </li>
                <li>
                    It also indicates a mood that wants to ensure that the benefits of reservation are widely spread
                </li>
                <li>
                    Increased attempts at linking benefits to Aadhaar allow us with an option to ensure that reservation
                    benefits are not captured by a few.

                    It involves collecting, transporting and treating fecal sludge and septage from pit latrines, septic

                    Sanitation workers are key to an effective FSM system. But with no proper disposal system or safety

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The sludge is nutrient-rich. After treatment, it can be given to farmers for use as organic compost.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It can even be treated and used for biogas, or to manufacture fuel pellets or ethanol.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once pathogens and bacteria are removed, the water can be used for irrigation, construction, by
                    industry in cooling plants etc
                </li>
                <li>
                    With appropriate training, sanitation workers can be empowered to own and run FSM businesses — much
                    like the producer cooperatives of the agriculture sector.

                    Gasification
                </strong>
                is a process that converts organic or fossil fuel based carbonaceous materials into carbon monoxide,
                hydrogen and carbon dioxide. This is achieved by reacting the material at high temperatures (&gt;700
                °C),
                <strong>
                    without combustion

                ,

                    with a controlled amount of oxygen and/or steam
                </strong>
                . The resulting gas mixture is called syngas (from synthesis gas) or producer gas and is itself a
                fuel./su_spoiler]

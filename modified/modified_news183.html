                            of the terror organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba, and kept him in detention under the Maintenance

                            Saeed’s detention was extended four times since January when the government cracked down on

                    Bankchain is a consortium of 27 banks (22 of them are Indian) of which the State Bank of India (SBI)
                    was the first Indian member
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is working to devise blockchain-based solutions for banking and, along with the SBI, planning to
                    launch a beta program to use smart contracts next month

                    About Blockchain and bitcoin
                </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In late 2008, an unknown person (or group) named Satoshi Nakamoto created a crypto-currency, bitcoin
                </li>
                <li>
                    Its novelty consists in the fact that its operations are authorized without any trusted third-party
                    carrying out administrative or security tasks
                </li>
                <li>
                    This minimizes the transaction fees eventually weighing on users and considerably reducing the time
                    for processing the operations
                </li>
                <li>
                    Centralized networks rely on one or more trusted bodies (for example, banks) to keep a detailed
                    record of transactions and update users’ balance
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bitcoin, on the other hand, decentralizes the administrative activity and lets “miners” process the
                    transactions carried out in the system
                </li>
                <li>
                    The transparency, accessibility and stability of the transactions’ record are ensured by the public
                    broadcasting of the operations throughout the nodes of the network (the computers running the
                    software)
                </li>
                <li>
                    And their subsequent addition to a shared database containing the complete transaction history for
                    any given bitcoin
                </li>
                <li>
                    This shared ledger is called the “blockchain”, i.e the sequence of all the verified “blocks” of
                    transactions, recorded chronologically—timestamped—one after the other
                </li>

                    Usability:
                </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Just as bitcoin uses the blockchain to maintain a ledger of a crypto-currency, the blockchain can be
                    used to keep track of the ownership of any asset or data that can be digitized and represented by
                    computer code
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once the asset is on blockchain, users can compose smart contracts that contain the terms of the
                    agreement, and automatically execute them once certain predetermined conditions are satisfied
                </li>
                <li>
                    They roughly follow the scheme of an “if-then” function
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            For example, if the smart contract relates to the acquisition of an intellectual property
                            right licence, Party A creates a smart contract to which the licence X is permanently
                            attached, programming that X is to be released upon certain conditions Y, and launches it
                            into a blockchain
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Whenever Party B wishes to obtain the information/licence, they transfer consideration Y to
                            the protocol
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Automatically, the smart contract algorithm releases X to party B and delivers Y to Party A,
                            eliminating delays and room for non-compliance
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Once the obligation is fulfilled on the one side (Y), the computer protocol autonomously
                            performs the other side of the agreement (X)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                    Disadvantages of traditional contracts:
                </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Traditional contracts are always subject to a degree of uncertainty with respect to their final
                    outcome
                </li>
                <li>
                    Smart contracts leave no room for voluntary breaches of the agreement
                </li>
                <li>
                    By entrusting the network with the performance of the agreed terms, they reduce the likelihood of
                    expensive and time-consuming disputes
                </li>
            </ul>

                    Why are banks reluctant to Blockchain?

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Smart contracts on a decentralized, “permission-less” blockchain like bitcoin don’t allow any
                    meddling by third parties
                </li>
                <li>
                    This is because in a permission-less system, any computer can join as a node to run the code and
                    amending the leger will require access to all the nodes
                </li>
                <li>
                    Banks are uncomfortable with losing control of the system and they prefer “permissioned” blockchains
                    like Bankchain
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bankchain restricts the access to nodes to other banks, while individual customers can join as users
                    after complying with know your customer (KYC) norms
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pre-selected nodes allow banks to intervene between transactions, providing the ‘emergency entry’
                    into the system whenever interventions are deemed appropriate
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Currently each bank carries out its own KYC process.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This can be done by one bank and securely uploaded on the blockchain, thereafter shared with the
                    other banks once the trigger is generated by the customer
                </li>
                <li>
                    Smart contracts can automatically release insurance payments for verifiable claims like delayed
                    flights, motor accidents or death
                </li>
                <li>
                    This would involve bringing authorized third parties like hospitals and garages to join a single
                    platform with insurers and the insured, and bring process efficiencies
                </li>
                <li>
                    Most securities have settlement delays of two days or longer that can be brought down to minutes,
                    which will also reduce working capital requirements for collateral
                </li>
                <li>
                    Other applications include crowdfunding for small businesses, enabling the trading of tokenized
                    equity shares and settlement of syndicated loans between banks

                    While permissioned blockchains bring many benefits of a decentralized network, they compromise on
                    the promise of immutability by limiting the nodes in the system
                </li>
                <li>
                    The unlimited nodes in bitcoin make it tamperproof while pre-selected nodes in a permissioned
                    blockchain allow authorities to intervene between transactions and expose the points of
                    vulnerability

                    Brahmos, the world class weapon with multi-platform, multi-mission role is now capable of being
                    launched from land, sea and air, completing the tactical cruise missile triad for India.

                <li>
                    The land and sea variants of Brahmos are already operational with the Army and the Navy. Recently,
                    the range variants were upgraded from 290 km to 450 km after India joined the Missile Technology
                    Control Regime (MTCR).

                        A building permitted for three floors, while being extended illegally to 6 floors by a builder,
                        collapses. As a consequence, a number of innocent labourers including women and children died.
                        These labourers are migrants of different places. The government immediately announced cash
                        relief to the aggrieved families and arrested the builder.

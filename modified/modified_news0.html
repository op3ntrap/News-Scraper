                                Iran has threatened to rope in Russian oil companies for developing the Farzad B gas
                                field, replacing the consortium of Indian state-run entities (ONGC Videsh Ltd) that

                                    90% of cancer deaths are caused when cancer cells break off from the origin and
                                    start spreading elsewhere in the body.

                                    growing afresh.

                                    A First Generation Mine-site (FGM) with an area of 18,000 sq km has been identified.
                                    Latest technologies for extraction of metals from the minerals have also been
                                    developed under the programme. Detailed environmental data has been collected for
                                    compliance with International Seabed Authorities requirements. Besides identifying
                                    the mineral resource and developing technologies for mining and extraction, the
                                    programme has also resulted in high impact research as well as manpower development.

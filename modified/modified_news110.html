                            The Indus Waters Treaty is a water-distribution treaty between India and Pakistan, brokered
                            by the World Bank (then the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The treaty was signed in Karachi on September 19, 1960 by Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal
                            Nehru and President of Pakistan Ayub Khan.

                            According to this agreement, control over the three “eastern” rivers — the Beas, the Ravi
                            and the Sutlej — was given to India, while control over the three “western” rivers — the
                            Indus, the Chenab and the Jhelum — to Pakistan.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            More controversial, however, were the provisions on how the waters were to be shared. Since
                            Pakistan’s rivers flow through India first, the treaty allowed India to use them for
                            irrigation, transport and power generation, while laying down precise regulations for Indian
                            building projects along the way.

                            The treaty was a result of Pakistani fear that, since the source rivers of the Indus basin
                            were in India, it could potentially create droughts and famines in Pakistan, especially at
                            times of war.

                        Plasmodium and Haemoproteus

                    is one of the most common and widespread diseases in birds.

                    Avian malaria leads to decrease in reproductive success, anaemia, changes in body condition and even
                    mortality in extreme cases.

                <li>
                    Mosquitoes transmit Plasmodium, while biting midges (Culicoides sp.) are responsible for
                    Haemoproteus transmission in birds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Human malaria follows a seasonal pattern in the Himalayan foothills with peak transmission from July
                    to October, where as the avian malaria parasites showed no peak and were found to stay in blood
                    throughout the year

                    Decisions has been reached on an expensive and time consuming process to install
                    <strong>
                        Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) modules

                    on the six new Scorpene submarines to be inducted over the next few years.

                    It will be installed by the Original Equipment Manufacturer, Naval Group.

                    AIP modules give stealth and extended endurance to diesel-electric submarines by allowing them to
                    stay submerged longer.

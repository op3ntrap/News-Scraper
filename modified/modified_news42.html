                    Falun Gong (literally, “Dharma Wheel Practice” or “Law Wheel Practice”) is a Chinese spiritual
                    practice that combines meditation and
                    <strong>
                        qigong exercises
                    </strong>
                    with a moral philosophy centered on the tenets of truthfulness, compassion, and forbearance
                </li>
                <li>
                    The practice emphasizes morality and the cultivation of virtue, and identifies as a qigong practice
                    of the Buddhist school, though its teachings also incorporate elements drawn from Taoist traditions.
                    Through moral rectitude and the practice of meditation, practitioners of Falun Gong aspire to
                    eliminate attachments, and ultimately to achieve spiritual enlightenment.

                    banned cattle sale in livestock markets for slaughter and religious sacrifices.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The rules banned trading in cattle for slaughter at animal markets. The rules included buffaloes in
                    their definition of cattle, raising concerns that they would jeopardize the buffalo meat export
                    business as the supply chain of spent buffaloes will be disrupted.

                    The Central rules drew criticism from various quarters, including opposition parties, who argued
                    that they virtually ban the sale of cattle in the country.

                    There are 1,66,000 students from India pursuing higher education in the U.S. now, up from about
                    1,00,000 two years earlier. A large majority of them pursue science, technology, engineering and

                Foreign students in the United States may be required to reapply every year for permission to stay in
                the country.

                The proposed measures could increase costs and paper work for students and universities.

                    The government on Monday raised the import duty on sugar to 50 per cent from 40 per cent to
                    discourage dumping of cheaper supplies from abroad and as local prices stabilise after a spike

                </li>
                <li>
                    The move will improve the ability of sugar mills to pay farmers for their supplies of cane,

                <li>
                    The hike in the duty comes as a relief for mills amid slowing domestic demand, especially after

                </li>
                <li>

                <li>
                    This will help the sugar industry pay the cane price (fair and remunerative price), which has been
                    raised by 11 per cent for the marketing year starting October 2017

                    In April this year, the government had allowed duty-free imports of raw sugar up to five lakh tonnes
                    to improve domestic availability
                </li>
                <li>
                    It was due to fear that a drop in domestic output in 2016-17 could trigger a spiral in prices to
                    irrational levels
                </li>
                <li>

                <li>
                    Using a mix of methods, including satellite-monitoring, traversing stretches of the river to collect
                    water samples and using special sensors to measure bacterial and chemical pollution, the researchers
                    are trying to develop a cost-effective forecast system.

                <li>
                    The team’s long-term objective is to be able to inform State officials and citizens of a probable
                    spike in, say, levels of dangerous microbes or effluents, similar to weather and air pollution
                    forecasts
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is to be able to access “raw data” that could be used to inform the efficacy of a proposed faecal
                    sludge treatment plant and whether behavioural interventions — including incentives or punishments —
                    to restrict activities that pollute the river could actually work.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The project measures parameters such as total dissolved salts, nitrate, pH, temperature, turbidity
                    and electrical conductivity. These are relayed to a website called Thoreau, a wireless sensing
                    network maintained at the University of Chicago to map environmental parameters, for analysis. Some
                    river attributes such as microbial levels require to be measured in laboratories, though the team
                    hopes eventually to be able to use low-cost sensors that measure them, too, in real time.

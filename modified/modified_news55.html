                    DNA Data Banks, both national and at state level, will be responsible for storing DNA profiles

                            Strict confidentiality in safekeeping of records of DNA profiles and their use. Violation of

                    </strong>
                    a law passed by Assam assembly 13 years ago to allow the then Congress government headed by Tarun
                    Gogoi to appoint MLAs as parliamentary secretaries after Parliament had put a cap on the number of

                <li>
                    This SC order striking down a law for appointment of parliamentary secretaries could nudge the

                termed it unconstitutional. The Bombay HC in 2009 had struck down appointment of two parliamentary
                secretaries in Goa. The Himachal Pradesh HC in 2005 had in a similar ruling struck down appointment of
                eight chief parliamentary secretaries and four parliamentary secretaries. In May 2015, the Hyderabad HC

                    Sickle cell disease and thalassemia are genetic disorders caused by errors in the
                    genesSickle_cell_01 for hemoglobin, a substance composed of a protein (globin) plus an iron molecule
                    (heme) that is responsible for carrying oxygen within the red blood cell. These disorders can cause
                    fatigue, jaundice, and episodes of pain ranging from mild to very severe. They are inherited, and
                    usually both parents must pass on an abnormal gene in order for a child to have the disease. When
                    this happens, the resulting diseases are serious and, at times, fatal.

                    red blood cells to carry oxygen around the body. This can make them very anaemic (tired, short of
                    breath and pale).

                    There is near unanimity among medico-legal experts that the MTP act has failed to keep up with
                    changes in science.

                    They argue that foetal abnormalities show up after 18 weeks and a two-week window after that is too
                    small for the parents to take the difficult call on keeping their baby.

                    The growing number of sexual crimes against women and the need to empower them with sexual rights
                    have also made it imperative that the MTP Act be changed.

                    mother or child, or if it is “alleged by the pregnant woman to have been caused by rape”.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Significantly, the draft recognises that “rape may be presumed to constitute a grave injury to the
                    mental health of the pregnant woman, and that such an injury could be a ground for allowing
                    abortion”.

        CAC adopts Codex norms for three spices

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) adopted three Codex standards for black, white and green
                    pepper, cumin and thyme paving the way for an universal agreement on identifying quality spices in
                    various countries.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The CAC cleared these standards at its session held in Geneva recently.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Why?
                    </strong>
                    The adoption of Codex standards for the three spices, it is pointed out, will help evolve a common
                    standardisation process for their global trade and availability of high quality, clean and safe
                    spices to the world.

                    What is ‘Food code’?
                </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Codex Alimentarius or “Food Code” is a collection of standards, guidelines and codes of practice
                    adopted by the Codex Alimentarius Commission.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Commission, also known as CAC, is the central part of the joint FAO (Food and Agricultural
                    Organization of the United Nations)/WHO (World Health Organisation) Food Standards Programme.
                </li>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The CAC move is considered a crucial endorsement of the India’s initiatives to usher in a common
                    standard across the globe for spices trade.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The adoption of Codex standards by CAC must be read in the context of the efforts put in by New
                    Delhi in arriving at a common code for spices trade.
                </li>
                <li>
                    India conducted three sessions of Codex Committee on Spices and Culinary Herbs (CCSCH) at Kochi
                    (2014), Goa (2015) and Chennai (2017).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Chennai session especially succeeded in achieving this consensus. Subsequently, these drafts
                    were placed before the CAC and the member-nations adopted them by consensus.

                    New diesel and petrol cars will be banned by 2040, as part of a package of measures designed to

                    <li>
                        Suppose one of your close friends, who is also aspiring for civil services, comes to you for
                        discussing some of the issues related to ethical conduct in public service. He raises the
                        following points:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                In the present times, when unethical environment is quite prevalent, individual attempts
                                to stick to ethical principles may cause a lot of problems in one’s career. It may also
                                cause hardship to the family members as well as risk to one’s life. Why should we not be
                                pragmatic and follow the path of least resistance, and be happy with doing whatever good
                                we can?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                When so many people are adopting wrong means and are grossly harming the system, what
                                difference would it make if only a small minority tries to be ethical? They are going to
                                be rather ineffective and are bound to get frustrated.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If we become fussy about ethical considerations, will it not hamper the economic
                                progress of our country? After all, in the present age of high competition, we cannot
                                afford to be left behind in the race of development.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                It is understandable that we should not get involved in grossly unethical practices, but
                                giving and accepting small gratifications and doing small favours increases everybody’s
                                motivation. It also makes the system more efficient. What is wrong in adopting such
                                practices?

                    Originally constructed in the early 1400s, the Forbidden City is considered to be among the most
                    important architectural and cultural monuments inside China. Designed to reflect the majesty of the
                    emperor, the vast walled complex consists of over 90 palaces and courtyards of varying significance.

                        proposed by the Tipra people of Tripura

                <li>
                    The Twipra Kingdom is a former country which was ruled by 184 Tripuri/Tipra kings. The last king was
                    <strong>
                        Maharaja Bir Bikram Kishore Manikya Bahadur Debbarma
                    </strong>
                    . After his death in 1946, Twipra kingdom joined India as a Union Territory on 15 October 1949 under
                    the name Tripura, and later achieved statehood.
                </li>

                    <strong>
                        Bengali Hindus and Muslims immigrated to Tripura
                    </strong>
                    , and slowly took political power from the Tipras. As the political and economic power shifted to
                    the immigrants, the very existence of the Tipra people and their culture was jeopardized.
                </li>

                    <strong>

                    </strong>
                    , which they finally achieved on 23 March 1979. However, the
                    <strong>
                        Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTAADC)
                    </strong>
                    was unable to protect the rights of the indigenous Tipra and other tribal communities.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Tipra people feel it has become clear that without full governmental power,
                    <strong>
                        the indigenous Tipra people cannot survive.
                    </strong>
                    Thus the Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura, a regional political party under the leadership of
                    N.C. Debbarma, has advocated for converting the TTAADC area into a full-fledged state.

                    The composition levy is an alternative method of levy of tax designed for small taxpayers whose
                    turnover is up to Rs. 75 lakhs ( Rs. 50 lakhs in case of few States).

                    scheme can pay tax at a prescribed percentage of his turnover every quarter, instead of paying tax
                    at normal rate.

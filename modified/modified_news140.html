                    The Supreme Court referred to a five-judge Constitution Bench the question whether the fundamental
                    right of women to pray at the place of their choice can be discriminated against solely based “on a
                    biological factor exclusive to the female gender.”

                <li>
                    Whether the ban qualifies as an “essential religious practice” of the Hindu faith, over which the

                    the Justice J.S. Verma committee recommendations that explained why the exemption of marital rape
                    must be removed, and that a marital or other relationship is not a defence or justification for a

                    Exemption of Marital rape in India:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The notion that marriage constitutes a contract, which includes the woman’s irrevocable consent to
                    sex
                </li>
                <li>
                    A woman is the property of her husband, and rape is a violation of a man’s property rather than a
                    crime against women
                </li>
                <li>
                    after marriage, a woman’s identity becomes part of her husband’s.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Indian government has consistently resisted a change in the law.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Even after 2012 Delhi gang rape case that resulted in in an amendment to the criminal legislation in
                    India, including the definition and punishment of rape.
                </li>
                <li>
                    However, the exemption of marital rape was retained, despite recommendations by the Justice Verma
                    committee.
                </li>
                <li>
                    According to lawmakers if marital rape is brought under the law, the entire family system will be
                    under great stress.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Recently Delhi High Court has been hearing petitions seeking the inclusion of marital rape under the
                    existing rape law.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This has been rejected by the government on the grounds that it will be used to harass men and will
                    affect the institution of marriage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A greater importance is being given by the government to marriage than women rights.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Women right activists do not believe in placing rape on a pedestal within the hierarchy of crimes
                    within a marriage.That is, for a woman who is facing domestic violence, it is equally violating if
                    her skull is fractured, her spine is broken, or her vagina is penetrated forcefully. What women
                    object to is the violence involved.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In cases of non-marital rape, judges have suggested that rape victims marry their rapist for a

                    Current scenario in USA
                </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In USA marital rape is treated differently from other forms of rape.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Although all 50 states had enacted laws against marital rape by 1993, almost half the States still
                    treat it differently from rape outside of marriage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In some states, marital rape is a chargeable offence only if the perpetrator uses or threatens to
                    use physical force.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Proof of marriage is often an easy way to reduce or mitigate the consequences of the offence.
                </li>
                <li>
                    These kinds of legal distinctions legitimise the perception among law-enforcement agencies that
                    cases of marital rape should be treated as less serious than rape outside of marriage.
                </li>

                    Way Forward
                </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A narrow focus on sexual violence ignores the multiplicity of suffering faced by women and can
                    result in inadequate attention being paid to their other needs. A broad focused policy approach is
                    needed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We need to ensure that law and policy interventions do not inadvertently trivialise non-sexual
                    violence and that steps are taken to strengthen compliance and implementation of laws relating to
                    all forms of violence.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is a need to recognise that removing the current marital exception, if nothing else, has an
                    important signalling effect.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In order to prove effective, such a change needs to be accompanied by a deliberate attempt to shift
                    attitudes that normalise violence in the home.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The strategies must focus on structural factors that prevent the incidence of rape, rather than
                    focussing only on strengthening response mechanisms.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Since gender socialisation begins young, there is need to focus interventions on children and
                    adolescents through family and societal institutions, popular culture and media. Disruptive and
                    violent environment at home must be prevented.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In addition to sensitising law enforcement authorities whose attitudes are merely symptomatic of
                    widely-held beliefs about women and gender roles, we need to work with children, parents and the
                    larger community to ensure marital rape is condemned, not condoned.

                    Research in neuroscience states that deep-seated ‘typical’ beliefs regarding race, caste, gender and
                    other social categories get embedded or hardwired in the brain
                </li>
                <li>
                    Inaccurate to start with, the brain finds it difficult to ‘unlearn’ them even when the reality has
                    changed. It interprets new data in a biased manner to confirm originally held beliefs (confirmatory
                    bias)

                    Can behavioural changes counter these stereotypes?

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Research in behavioural design provides evidence that this is indeed possible and has been
                    successfully pursued in many countries

            <ul>

                    Government and corporate sector policies, instead of taking steps to encourage and hasten this
                    permeability, have been misguided
                </li>
                <li>
                    The flawed legislation introduced recently increasing maternity benefits from three to six months is
                    a case in point
                </li>
                <li>
                    For ensuring that women don’t opt out of work, it reinforces gendered norms and unwittingly places
                    women at a disadvantage
                </li>
                <li>
                    What could have helped instead is a combination of maternity and paternity leave, on a ‘use it or it
                    lapses’ basis

                    Involving women in the decisionmaking process and in leadership roles, rather than providing

                </li>
                <li>
                    Behavioral design, when complemented by a judicious mix of legislation and incentives, can go a long

                <strong>
                    Context:
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Recent SC order banning the sale of firecrackers in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR), which
                has expectedly turned into a controversy
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Two Issues:
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    The scope of the state’s regulatory power vis-à-vis a religious celebration:
                </strong>
                On this account, the matter is relatively clear
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The bursting of firecrackers releases a heavy dose of carcinogens in the atmosphere, presenting a
                    public health challenge for the entire city
                </li>
                <li>
                    As soon as it is clear that bursting of firecrackers by one person presents a health challenge to
                    another, any argument of religion cannot reign supreme in a constitutional, secular republic
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    The agency of the state that such regulation should vest with
                </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The more difficult question is the choice between regulation
                </li>
                <li>
                    The decision requires numerous inputs from scientific organizations, regulatory institutions, public
                    policy experts and civil society
                </li>
                <li>
                    Since a court of law does not have in-house expertise in these domains, it should leave such matters
                    to the executive
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Supreme Court delivered its arguments in the broader framework of the “right to breathe clean
                    air” and the “right to health”
                </li>
                <li>
                    But it went about dismissing the commercial considerations of the firecracker industry.
                </li>
                <li>
                    These considerations could have equally been framed in terms of the right to livelihoods of
                    thousands who depend heavily on the sale of firecrackers during Diwali
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Creditability of SC:
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Bans are rarely effective
                </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    It is difficult to imagine that no firecracker sale will happen in the entire territory of Delhi and
                    NCR as a result of the SC order
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the police fail to enforce the order, the credibility of the SC, particularly in cases of
                    environmental regulation, will suffer immensely
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Dealing of this matter by the SC
                </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The manner in which the SC has dealt with this particular case also raises a number of concerns
                </li>
                <li>
                    It first passed an order on 11 November 2016 (after Diwali) banning the sale of firecrackers
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then it partially lifted the ban on 12 September 2017
                </li>
                <li>
                    To make matters worse, the court has ordered suspension of all the temporary licences issued after
                    its 12 September 2017 verdict which allowed the grant of these licences
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Not a new issue:
                </strong>
                In an earlier instance, the SC had increased the entry tax on trucks entering Delhi without factoring in
                the demand elasticity of goods (carried in those trucks) transported to Delhi
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    The way forward
                </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The elected government is in the best position to elicit scientific and economic inputs and take a
                    call, even if it involves expending political capital
                </li>
                <li>
                    The governments at the Centre and the states should involve different agencies like the Petroleum
                    and Explosives Safety Organisation and the pollution control boards and invest in setting regulatory
                    standards
                </li>
                <li>
                    This can solve environment issues, better than Judiciary
                </li>

                One of the scientists working in the R &amp; D laboratory of a major pharmaceutical company discovers
                that one of the company’s bestselling veterinary drugs, B has the potential to cure a currently
                incurable liver disease that is prevalent in tribal areas. However, developing a variant of the drug
                suitable for human beings entailed a lot of research and development having a huge expenditure to the
                extent of 50 crores rupees. It was unlikely that the company would recover the costs as the disease was
                rampant only in poverty-stricken area having very little market otherwise.

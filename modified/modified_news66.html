                        India’s manufacturing activity in July slumped to its lowest level since February 2009, dragged
                        down by disruptions to business activity following the introduction of Goods and Services Tax
                        (GST)

                    <li>
                        The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) stood at 47.9 in July, down from
                        50.9 in June, and highlighted the first deterioration in business conditions in 2017 so far
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        July also marked the biggest month-on-month decline since November 2008, just after the collapse
                        of Lehman Brothers triggered the global financial crisis

                    <li>
                        This contraction is likely to put pressure on the Reserve Bank of India to lower interest rate
                        at its policy meet.

                    <li>
                        The reductions in output, new orders and purchasing activity were all the steepest since early

                    <li>
                        However, foreign demand for India-manufactured goods improved in July as new export orders
                        continued to rise.

                            One of the scientists working in the R &amp; D laboratory of a major pharmaceutical company
                            discovers that one of the company’s bestselling veterinary drugs, B has the potential to
                            cure a currently incurable liver disease that is prevalent in tribal areas. However,
                            developing a variant of the drug suitable for human beings entailed a lot of research and
                            development having a huge expenditure to the extent of 50 crores rupees. It was unlikely
                            that the company would recover the costs as the disease was rampant only in poverty-stricken
                            area having very little market otherwise.

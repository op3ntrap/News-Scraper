                            The new global standard on Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) reduces the possibility
                            for tax evasion. It provides for the exchange of non-resident financial account information
                            with the tax authorities in the account holders’ country of residence. Participating
                            jurisdictions that implement AEOI send and receive pre-agreed information each year, without
                            having to send a specific request.

                            AEOI will enable the discovery of formerly undetected tax evasion. It will enable
                            governments to recover tax revenue lost to non-compliant taxpayers, and will further
                            strengthen international efforts to increase transparency, cooperation, and accountability
                            among financial institutions and tax administrations. Additionally, AEOI will generate
                            secondary benefits by increasing voluntary disclosures of concealed assets and by
                            encouraging taxpayers to report all relevant information.

                            clear, but is likely to be a few days. The symptoms are similar to other arbovirus
                            infections such as dengue, and include fever, skin rashes, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint
                            pain, malaise, and headache. These symptoms are usually mild and last for 2-7 days.

                            Based on a systematic review of the literature up to 30 May 2016, WHO has concluded that
                            Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of congenital brain abnormalities,
                            including microcephaly; and that Zika virus is a trigger of Guillain-Barré syndrome. Intense
                            efforts are continuing to investigate the link between Zika virus and a range of
                            neurological disorders, within a rigorous research framework.

                            Zika virus is primarily transmitted to people through the bite of an infected mosquito from
                            the Aedes genus, mainly Aedes aegypti in tropical regions. Aedes mosquitoes usually bite
                            during the day, peaking during early morning and late afternoon/evening. This is the same
                            mosquito that transmits dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever. Sexual transmission of Zika
                            virus is also possible. Other modes of transmission such as blood transfusion are being
                            investigated.

                                receiving enough oxygen. The reduced blood flow is usually the result of a partial or
                                complete blockage of your heart’s arteries.

                    Conventional wisdom suggests that economic reforms succeeding liberalization policy of government in
                    early 1990s should have reduced gender discrimination—but that hasn’t really been the case.
                </li>
                <li>
                    India’s gender balance in entrepreneurship and jobs remains among the lowest in the world.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Globalization and trade policy have made a limited contribution towards India’s convergence in
                    gender segmentation.

                    Liberalization and gender Discrimination:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Increased market competition, forces firms to eliminate inefficient discriminatory practices,
                    including gender discrimination
                </li>
                <li>
                    Market competition works in favour of women, as women are more competitive, and offer cheaper and
                    more flexible labour vis-à-vis men.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The share of females in manufacturing employment has barely increased over the last two decades.
                    Female activity is largely concentrated in the unorganized sector.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Women entrepreneurs are more dominant in industries that pay lower average wages.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Despite many competitive reforms that India has undertaken, this pattern of gender-based
                    segmentation has been accentuated over the years.
                </li>

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The female ownership shares are highest and typically exceed 50% in industries related to chemicals
                    and chemical products, tobacco products, and paper and paper products.
                </li>
                <li>
                    At the opposite end, female ownership shares are 2% or less in industries related to computers,
                    motor vehicles, fabricated metal products, and machinery and equipment.
                </li>

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Among service industries, female ownership shares exceed 30% in industries related to sanitation and
                    education. Industries related to research and development, water transport, and land transport have
                    the lowest female ownership rates, at 1% or less.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The female ownership rates in major cities tend to be higher than overall state averages.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The states with the highest female service sector ownership rates are Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra
                    Pradesh, with average female ownership shares exceeding 12%.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The lowest female ownership rates are in Rajasthan, Bihar, Odisha, and Uttar Pradesh, each with 6%
                    or less. It is surprising that the nation’s capital, Delhi, has the lowest share of female-owned
                    establishments in manufacturing. Its position in the services sector is only slightly above the
                    national average.

                    Factors Affecting Female Entry into various Industries
                </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Empirical results suggest that a district/industry with more incumbent female employment has a
                    greater female entry share. Among district-level traits, a higher female-to-male ratio, an age
                    profile emphasizing working age population, and better quality infrastructure appear important.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Inadequate infrastructure also affects women more than men, because women are often responsible for
                    a larger share of, and often more time-consuming, household activities.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In particular, transport infrastructure and paved roads within villages play an important role.
                    Travel in India can be restrictive and unpredictable, and women face greater constraints in
                    geographic mobility imposed by safety concerns and social norms.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Better electricity and water access may reduce the burden of women in providing essential household
                    inputs for their families, and allow for more time to be directed toward entrepreneurial activities.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Way forward:
                </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    India’s 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, passed in 1992, instituted one-third seat reservations
                    for women in local governance bodies. The political empowerment of women had huge beneficial
                    effects. The political reservation for women has gained India global recognition.
                </li>
                <li>
                    India’s economic liberalization and increased market competition has not eliminated gender
                    segmentation. However, improved physical and human infrastructure, and domestic pro-competitive
                    reforms have reduced gender segmentation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Gender will play a bigger and more strategic role in India’s future growth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This growth will come in many forms: increased female labour force participation, improvements in
                    productivity, elimination of gender discrimination in access to bank loans, and increased voice and
                    political representation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Simply put, empowering half of the potential workforce has significant economic benefits beyond
                    promoting gender equality.

                    Dealing with 21st century challenges with the (currently applicable) Police Act of 1861 creates lots
                    of issues
                </li>
                <li>
                    The politicization of the police is a tough problem to solve in an environment in which money,
                    votes, and instruments of intimidation (misuse of the police) mix
                </li>
                <li>
                    According to a Takshashila Institution survey of public trust, state police organizations rank last
                    among government organizations and agencies
                </li>
                <li>
                    Numerous committees and commissions have opined on the issue of police reform
                </li>
                <li>
                    Most of them have approached the problem from a quantity, capacity, capability, training,
                    compensation and benefits point of view
                </li>
                <li>
                    The solutions may generally be grouped into the idea of “if you make the policeman’s conditions
                    better, then everything will improve”
                </li>

                <strong>
                    Second Administrative Reforms Commission (ARC) and police reforms:
                </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The ARC recommended that the investigative functions of police be separated from the day-to-day law
                    and order functions
                </li>
                <li>
                    And the superintendence of the government over police be restricted in such a manner that the force
                    retains operational autonomy
                </li>
                <li>
                    It suggested a State Accountability Commission made up of five members of government, including the
                    home minister and chief secretary and five non-partisan eminent citizens
                </li>
                <li>
                    The ARC recommendation resolved the politicization dilemma by delegating operational control to the
                    force and democratizing governance to a commission
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Codifying checks and balances in respective police Acts will bring assurance against illegal orders
                    by the political establishment to the police
                </li>
                <li>
                    Currently, politicians use the power of the police for their purposes, but sidestep any
                    responsibility for their failures
                </li>
                <li>
                    Only by giving full accountability to the politicians can society hold the politicians responsible
                    for their actions
                </li>
                <li>
                    Only when full political accountability joints with the betterment in capacity, capability and
                    equipment can we begin true police reform

                <li>
                    In 1994 Reserve Bank of India (RBI), announced a landmark decision to fully deregulate interest
                    rates on advances above Rs 2 lakh.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Since then, the RBI has introduced four benchmark lending rates for proper pricing of loans and
                    transmission of rates. However, these rate structures have been found to be ineffective for various
                    reasons.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The RBI has now formed a committee to formulate market-determined benchmarks to ensure a better
                    transmission of interest rates.

                    What is Monetary transmission?
                </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Monetary transmission refers to the process by which a central bank’s monetary policy decisions are
                    passed on, through financial markets, to businesses and households.
                </li>

                <li>
                    It included all those elements of the lending rate that are common across all categories of
                    borrowers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Banks are allowed to determine their actual lending rates on loans and advances with reference to
                    the base rate and by including such other customer-specific charges as considered appropriate.
                </li>
                <li>
                    While all categories of loans are required to be priced only with reference to the base rate,
                    transmission of the RBI rate cuts moved at snail’s pace
                </li>
                <li>
                    Banks and markets also briefly experimented with the Mumbai inter-bank offer rate (Mibor) on the
                    lines of London’s Libor
                </li>

                <li>
                    In June 1998, the National Stock Exchange had developed and launched the Mumbai inter-bank bid
                    (Mibid) rate and Mibor for the overnight money market.
                </li>
                <li>
                    However, banks found it difficult to use external benchmarks for pricing their loan products, as the
                    available external market benchmarks (Mibor, G-Sec) are mainly driven by liquidity conditions in the
                    market, and do not reflect the cost of funds of the banks

                <li>
                    MCLR was experiment which was kicked off when Raghuram Rajan was the RBI Governor.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    RBI Governor Urjit Patel said experience with the MCLR system, introduced in April 2016 for
                    improving the monetary policy transmission, has not been entirely satisfactory
                </li>
                <li>
                    Banks have been selective in their rate cuts in aggressive segments such as home and auto loans, but
                    in many other segments, borrowers are still tied to the base rate, where they can ease more.
                </li>
                <li>
                    RBI’s rate cuts have not been passed on to borrowers in many segments of the economy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The base rate of some banks after the introduction of MCLR has moved significantly less than MCLR.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The RBI says that the rigidity of the base rate is a matter of concern for an efficient transmission
                    of monetary policy to the real economy
                </li>
                <li>
                    MCLR failed to bring any cheers to old customers who were stuck with BPLR or base rate-linked rates.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The RBI is likely to come up with another benchmark lending rate for borrowers, speeding up the
                    transmission of rate cuts to the customers.

                    According to SC judgement, the State Food Commission set up under the National Food Security Act in
                    Haryana, has been sitting “jobless” and “without proper infrastructure”

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Primary source of domestic water and irrigation is groundwater but the media and policymakers still
                    focussing on surface water.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This needs to change as water tables have been falling rapidly in many parts of the country, and use
                    exceeds replenishment.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Landowner have the right to access groundwater found under their land, and they see groundwater as
                    their own and as a resource they can exploit without considering the need to protect and replenish
                    it since there are no immediate consequences for over-exploiting it.

                <li>
                    Access to a source of groundwater has become a source of power and economic gain

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Mechanical pumping led to the situation that recharge could not keep pace with use.

                    1970 model Bill focused on State-level control over new, additional uses of groundwater but did not
                    address the iniquitous regime giving landowners unlimited control over groundwater.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The States that have groundwater legislation based on the model Bill,1970 failed to address the
                    problem of falling water tables due to increasing use
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is no provision to protect and conserve groundwater at the aquifer level.

                <li>
                    It fails to give gram sabhas and panchayats a prevailing say in the regulation and the framework
                    remains mostly top-down and is incapable of addressing local situations adequately.

                    Based on the recognition of the unitary nature of water, the need for decentralised control over

                </li>
                <li>
                    Recognition that water is a public trust (groundwater is a common pool resource), the recognition of
                    the fundamental right to water and the introduction of protection principles, including the
                    precautionary principle, that are currently absent from water legislation.

                Rameshwar successfully cleared the prestigious civil services examination and was excited about the
                opportunity that he would get through the civil services to serve the country. However, soon after
                joining the services, he realized that things are not as rosy as he had imagined. He found a number of
                malpractices prevailing in the department assigned to him. For example, funds under various schemes and
                grants were being misappropriated. The official facilities were frequently being used for personal needs
                by the officers and staff. After some time, he noticed that the process of recruiting the staff was also
                not up to the mark. Prospective candidates were required to write an examination in which a lot of
                cheating was going on. Some candidates were provided external help in the examination. Rameshwar brought
                these incidents to the notice of his seniors. However, he was advised to keep his eyes, ears and mouth
                shut and ignores all these things which were taking place with the connivance of the higher-ups.
                Rameshwar felt highly disillusioned and uncomfortable. He comes to you seeking your advice. Indicate
                various options that you think are available in this situation. How would you help him to evaluate these
                options and choose the most appropriate path to be adopted? 250 words.

                        short-term crop loans at an affordable rate to give a boost to agricultural productivity and
                        production in the country.

                            In the context of India, interest subvention is mostly in the matter of government lending
                            schemes to promote a particular industry sector. The subsidy helps the loan borrower in not
                            having to pay the total interest amount on a loan amount. Therefore, the government pays
                            part of the interest amount for the borrower, thereby lessening the borrower’s overall
                            repayment burden.

                        One of the most successful life-forms on the planet, Emiliania huxleyi is a single-celled
                        organism visible only under a microscope.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Its astonishing adaptability enables it to thrive in waters from the equator to the sub-Arctic.

                        Emiliania huxleyi is a species of coccolithophore (phytoplankton).

                        This particular organism is plated with white calcium carbonate and, when present in large
                        numbers, tend to turn the water a milky sheen

                        The Bosphorus is a narrow, natural strait and an internationally significant waterway located in
                        northwestern Turkey.

                    <li>
                        It forms part of the continental boundary between Europe and Asia, and separates Asian Turkey
                        from European Turkey.

                    <li>
                        The world’s narrowest strait used for international navigation, the Bosphorus connects the Black
                        Sea with the Sea of Marmara, and, by extension via the Dardanelles, the Aegean and Mediterranean
                        Seas.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Together with the Dardanelles, the Bosphorus forms the Turkish Straits.

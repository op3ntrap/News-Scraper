                        At present about 200 Afghan soldiers are trained at a time at the Indian Military Academy,
                        including 130 cadets and 30 to 40 officers.

                        The training of police officers, which India had first offered to Afghanistan in 2011, will be a
                        significant step in security ties, which are a small part of the relationship, compared with
                        India’s $3 billion investment in civilian projects since 2002, with 116 new projects announced
                        this month.

                        In 2016, India sent Afghanistan four Russian-made Mi-25 helicopters, but has yet to concede to
                        Afghan requests for more equipment, transport vehicles, while an agreement for Indian engineers
                        to repair the helicopters and to refurbish old aircraft that is non-functional, has still not
                        been finalised.

                        The population of vertebrate species on Earth in the wild saw a dramatic fall of about 30%

                        Habitats destruction by pollutants and land-use change are destroying flora and fauna at

                    <li>
                        According to the Stockholm Environment Institute, the elements of the biophysical world that
                        link us together are often regarded as a “safe operating space for humanity”.

                        These planetary boundaries include loss of biodiversity, land-use change, changes to nitrogen
                        and phosphorus cycles, ocean acidification, atmospheric aerosols loading, ozone depletion,
                        chemical production, freshwater use and, of course, climate change.

                        Since the last ice age, the Holocene epoch has offered a stable climate, a period of grace for
                        humanity to grow and to flourish, with settlements, agriculture, economic and population
                        expansion.

                    <li>
                        Today the Anthropocene epoch, whose exact beginnings are debated, but which has led to
                        over-reliance on fossil fuels, industrial agriculture, pollution in water, soils and air, loss
                        of species and so on, have been devastating for many life forms and connected ecosystems
                        throughout the planet.

                    <li>
                        The ecosystems that are stressed by their exposure to pollutants may not recover once the
                        pollutants are removed.

                    <li>
                        These boundaries interact with one another and cause changes across scales, crossing a threshold
                        in one domain can speed up or undermine processes in another subsystem.

                    <li>
                        For instance, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions increase ocean acidification, land-use change often
                        increases GHG emissions, and increasing nitrogen and phosphorus deplete species biodiversity and
                        freshwater resources and increase warming from climate change.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Considering the stats today earth is already about a degree Celsius warmer than average
                        pre-industrial temperatures.

                        Thus planetary boundaries as support systems for life on Earth should be viewed as expressing

                            Prof. Swaminathan is a geneticist, known as “Indian Father of Green Revolution” for his key
                            contributions in Green Revolution (1960s) where he introduced high yielding varieties of
                            wheat. Under his leadership, the committee submitted its report in five instalments over the
                            period from December, 2004 to October, 2006. These reports made several recommendations for
                            improvement in the situation of farmers in India. While several criticized the Government
                            for not implementing the recommendations of this committee properly, other few questioned
                            the recommendations itself.

                                The major causes of the agrarian crisis are: unfinished agenda in land reform, quantity
                                and quality of water, technology fatigue, access, adequacy and timeliness of
                                institutional credit, and opportunities for assured and remunerative marketing. Adverse
                                meteorological factors add to these problems.

                                Land Reforms were considered necessary and key suggestions in this regards were to
                                distribute ceiling-surplus and waste lands; prevent diversion of agricultural land &amp;
                                forest to corporate sector for non-agricultural purposes; ensure grazing rights &amp;
                                seasonal access to forests to tribals and pastoralists; establish a National Land Use
                                Advisory Service, etc.

                                Timely and adequate supply of credit is a basic requirement of small farm families and
                                to enhance the same key suggestions of the committee were: expand the outreach of Credit
                                facilities System; issue Kisan Credit Cards to women farmers; establish an Agriculture
                                Risk Fund to provide relief to farmers in the aftermath of successive natural
                                calamities, etc.

                                28% of the families in India were found to be Below Poverty Line and therefore, food
                                security needed attention. The committee recommended: ensure availability of quality
                                seed and other inputs at affordable costs; Set up Village Knowledge Centres (VKCs) or
                                Gyan Chaupals in the farmers’ distress hotspots; need for focused Market Intervention
                                Schemes (MIS) in the case of life-saving crops; have a Price Stabilisation Fund in place
                                to protect the farmers from price fluctuations, etc.

                                Improving the competitiveness of the small farmers was considered necessary. Suggestions
                                in this area included: improvement in implementation of Minimum Support Price (MSP); MSP
                                should be at least 50% more than the weighted average cost of production; availability
                                of data about spot and future prices of commodities through the Multi Commodity Exchange
                                (MCD) and the NCDEX, etc.

                                The committee highlighted the need to create productive employment opportunities and to
                                improve the quality of employment in several sectors such that real wages rise through
                                improved productivity. For this purpose committee recommended emphasizing on relatively
                                more labour intensive sectors and inducing a faster growth of these sectors and ensuring
                                that the net take home income of farmers should be comparable to those of civil
                                servants.

                                access to biodiversity and conservation, enhancement and improvement of crops, farm
                                animals &amp; fish stocks through breeding, etc.

                                The proposal comes close on the heels of several States, opposing the formation of an
                                all-India judicial service, a 60-year-old idea.

                                While the sanctioned strength is 20,502, the actual number of judges/judicial officers
                                in subordinate courts is 16,050.

                                The Ministry has suggested various models to the apex court so that vacancies in the
                                subordinate courts are filled up fast. It also proposed that UPSC can hold an exam to
                                recruit judicial officers.

                                about 15% of India’s gross domestic product (GDP) and a failed monsoon can have a
                                rippling effect on the country’s growth and economy.

                                kharif, or summer, crops like rice, sugar cane, pulses and oilseeds begins with the
                                arrival of monsoon rains in June.

                                A deficit monsoon could also lead to a drought-like situation, thereby affecting the

                                A poor monsoon not only leads to weak demand for fast-moving consumer goods,
                                two-wheelers, tractors and rural housing sectors but also increases the imports of
                                essential food staples and forces the government to take measures like farm loan
                                waivers, thereby putting pressure on finances. Whereas a normal monsoon results in a
                                good harvest, which in turn lifts rural incomes and boosts spending on consumer goods.
                                It also has a positive impact on hydro power projects.

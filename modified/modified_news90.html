                    Proposed bill will not fix a single national level minimum wage for the whole country, but will vary
                    across states and geographies.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Code on Wages Bill 2017: “It provides for national minimum wage for different geographical areas so
                    as to ensure that no State Government fixes the minimum wage below the national minimum wage,
                    notified for that area by the Central Government,”

                <li>
                    The Centre will fix different wages through a notification after consulting the Central Advisory

                    Bellandur lake in Bengaluru has been much in the news for the outpouring foam and froth and the rise
                    of smoke and flames from the area surrounding it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    City’s heaviest rains in a century, rose the froth and foam as high as 10 to 12 feet from Bellandur
                    and spread onto the streets, endangering traffic and entering shops and homes across the road,
                    causing huge inconvenience to those living in the area.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In May 2015, the Bellandur lake itself was on fire, creating enormous fear and anxiety in the minds
                    of the people living in the area.

                <li>
                    The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) submitted a report to the Union Ministry of Environment,
                    Forests and Climate Change, which resulted in setting up an expert committee by the state
                    government.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The report highlights the sustained inflow of untreated sewage and industrial effluents as the
                    principal forces behind the phenomena of froth and fire.

                    The Silicon Valley of India, which has been known for its hundreds of lakes originally built in the
                    16th century by damming the natural valley systems is threatened with pollution today.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The National Green Tribunal has issued a number of directions emphasising the need for removal of
                    silt from the lake, treatment of municipal sewage which is going into the water body, closure of
                    polluting industries, ban on dumping of municipal solid waste around the lake, penalty on apartment
                    buildings in the area which are sending untreated sewage to the lake and an environmental fine of Rs
                    5 lakh on anyone found dumping waste in and around the lake.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The untreated wastewater or sewage of local waterbodies feeds the growth of water-weeds, which
                    blankets surface water.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Apparently, the huge roots of water hyacinth absorb impurities and can lock up pollutants in the
                    water.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The microbes feeding on the rotting organic matter consume all the oxygen in the water, disturbing
                    the ecology for the survival of fish life.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When such organic matter naturally breaks down, it releases fatty acids that float to the surface.
                    This is how foam is formed and turns into froth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The phosphorus content in the detergents in India is much higher than 2.2 per cent, which
                    contributes to the formation of these weeds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Urban planning in India must ensure that wetlands which are natural recharge zones are typically not
                    disturbed

                    According to the CPCB, 75 per cent of the measured pollution in our rivers from point sources is
                    from municipal sewage and 25 per cent is from industrial effluents.

                Question 1.
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            You are stranded in traffic in your car. You are driving the car. A poor girl looking very frail approaches
            you and start begging for money. Looking at her frail appearance, out of compassion, you take out your
            wallet to search for a ten Rupees note. The girl who is standing very near to you snatches the wallet
            and starts running. A man on a motorbike who see this act, catches the girl and starts beating her in full
            view of public. Now the traffic is moving and your car is in the middle of the road.
            <br/>
            What will you do in such a situation? Explain the course of action and reason?
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>
                <strong>

        </p>
        <p>
            Action should be as follow:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Park Car- so that no disturbance to the traffic
            </li>
            <li>
                Call to destination where I was heading about the emergency so that they will not wait for me.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reach the spot where the man is beating girl and immediately stop him and ask him not to beat or take
                law in his hand. Thank him for taking notice of the theft and taking action, but remind him that the
                girl is very young and could have acted out of hunger too. Remind him gently that it is a public space
                and such act physical violence could land him in legal trouble. This should lower his anger.
            </li>
            <li>
                If girl is injured- carry out first aid from the box available in the car. Get her something to eat and
                drink.
            </li>
            <li>
                Try to know her history and then informing to NGO or child care centre and personally taking to there
                will be my choice since leaving her just like that will make her to repeat the act since it’s the
                poverty and poor care made her to act. If these are given girl will desist from such acts.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make an occasional follow up of the girl with the agency to whom she had been handed over to.
            </li>
        </ul>

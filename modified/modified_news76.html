                        the brain.

                        The disease can occur in people of all ages, but children and the elderly are more at risk of
                        being afflicted with the disease.

                    <li>
                        The usual cause of the rare disease is either a viral infection.

                    <li>
                        Sometimes it is caused when the brain’s own immune system mistakenly attacks brain tissue.

                    <li>
                        In rare cases, encephalitis is caused due to bacterial infection, parasites, or may be prompted
                        from other infectious diseases.

                        One of the most common form of viral encephalitis in Asia is the Japanese encephalitis virus
                        (JEV), caused by mosquito-borne flavivirus.

                    <li>
                        JEV primarily affects children as most adults tend to attain natural immunity from the disease,

                        People should also use proper clothing to prevent being bitten by mosquitoes in

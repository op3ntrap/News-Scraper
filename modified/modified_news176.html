                        maintain power destroyed one of Africa’s most promising states.

                        The government is planning to ask more public sector banks to enter into an agreement with it if
                        they want more capital, provided banks improve their performance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Earlier, the government had entered into an agreement with 11 banks, and had asked them to
                        submit a turnaround plan and had linked capital infusion with the pace of turnaround.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In the earlier round of MoUs, banks were asked to achieve several parameters such as reduction
                        in gross non-performing assets, increase in recovery, restriction of slippages, among others. In
                        other words, capital infusion in these laggard banks were to be linked to their performance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Recently, the government had announced a capital infusion of Rs.11 lakh crore in public sector
                        banks over two financial years, starting from the current fiscal.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Of the amount, the government plans to issue recapitalisation bonds worth Rs.35 lakh crore and
                        the remaining would come from budgetary provisions and fund raising by banks from the market.

                        In a bid to make Indian roads safer and curb fatalities, a global charity unveiled an
                        <strong>
                            India Road Assessment Programme (IndiaRAP)
                        </strong>
                        that will rate highways’ safety levels, and seek to eliminate the most unsafe roads.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The ratings are assigned on the basis of the level of safety which is ‘built-in’ to a road for
                        vehicle occupants, motorcyclists, bicyclists and pedestrians.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Five-star roads are the safest while one-star roads are the least safe.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The IndiaRAP programme is being supported by FedEx Express and will be hosted by the Asian
                        Institute of Transport Development, and will work with government agencies as well as investors,
                        researchers and NGOs to assess existing highways and promote the use of better design to make
                        roads safer.

                            Key Fact:
                        </strong>
                        In January last year, the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance decided to
                        move the country up to BS-VI from the current BS-IV standards by 2020, skipping an intermediate
                        level.

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A 2016 report by Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, showed that cars and jeeps emit less
                        than 10% of particulate matter, while trucks are the bigger culprits.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A big contributor to Delhi’s air pollution is road dust, which accounts for about 35% of tiny
                        particles known as PM 2.5 in the air, followed by vehicles at 25%.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Other contributors are domestic cooking, power plants and industries.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        PM 2.5 are tiny particles in the air that reduce visibility and cause the air to appear hazy
                        when levels are elevated.

                        Study estimates that 586,787 premature deaths in India were attributable to fine particulate
                        matter pollution in 2013.

                        NOx, or oxides of nitrogen, are also major pollutants. They are a family of poisonous, highly
                        reactive gases that form when fuel is burned at high temperatures.

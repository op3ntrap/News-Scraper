                    The data website India Spend has compiled instances of cow-linked violence from 2010 to 2017. It
                    found that during this period, 28 people were killed in 63 such incidents.

                    An overwhelming 97% of these attacks took place after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government came
                    to power in May 2014.
                </li>
                <li>
                    About 86% of those killed were Muslims. In 21% of the cases, the police filed cases against the
                    victims/survivors.

                <li>
                    Cow-related lynchings rose sharply in 2017. This marks a 75% increase over 2016, which had been the
                    worst year for mob lynchings since 2010.

                    Why anti-lynching law is necessary?
                </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    It fills a void in our criminal jurisprudence.
                </li>
                <li>
                    At present there is no law that criminalises mob killings. The Indian Penal Code has provisions for
                    unlawful assembly, rioting, and murder but nothing that takes cognisance of a group of people coming
                    together to kill (a lynch mob).

                    Under
                    <strong>
                        Section 223 (a) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC),
                    </strong>
                    to prosecute together two or more people accused of the same offence committed in the course of the
                    “same transaction”.
                </li>
                <li>
                    But the provision falls far short of an adequate legal framework for prosecuting lynch mobs

                    the underlying premise that a generic anti-lynching law could address India’s lynching problem.

            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Reason for the rise in lynchings
                </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Major reason for the recent rise in lynchings is impunity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The lynch mobs that murdered several people were confident of getting away with it. So far, the
                    state has done little to shake that confidence.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The problem is not mob lynching per se but the mob lynching of minorities, for that is where
                    impunity kicks in.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the case of cow-linked lynchings, a lot depends on whether the incumbent in power considers it
                    compatible with its political interests to crack down on such attacks.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Advocates of Masuka appear reluctant to name the problem –targeted communal lynchings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It actually is a minority issue, and that is why the majority needs to take it up.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Any political mobilisation for the protection of minorities would be anxious about the bogey of
                    minority appeasement.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It could even mean that an anti-lynching Bill stands less chance of making it through Parliament

            <ul>
                <li>
                    A truly ‘civil’ society should feel no hesitation in demanding that the state protect its minorities
                    because protection of minorities is one of the biggest responsibilities of any democracy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The UN has a Special Rapporteur for minority issues precisely because it recognises that “minorities
                    in all regions of the world continue to face serious threats”

                <li>
                    But the Anti-Communal Violence Bill was buried because it was felt that it threatened the autonomy
                    of States by mooting a parallel structure that undermined federalism.

                    A PBO is an independent and impartial body linked directly to Parliament

                <li>
                    A PBO is comprised of independent and specialised staff, such as Budget analysts, economists, public

                </li>
                <li>

                    Its core functions include Budget approval, scrutiny of its implementation
                </li>
                <li>
                    The PBO must be non-partisan, independent and mandated to serve all parliamentarians

                <li>
                    Its output, and the methods by which those outputs are prepared must be transparent, accessible and

                <li>
                    But this argument is flawed because Parliament is a Budget-approving body and its members must be
                    well-informed for a legitimate approving process
                </li>
                <li>
                    PBO is an instrument for addressing bias towards spending and deficits
                </li>
                <li>
                    It can generate quality public debate on Budget policy and public finance, enabling parliamentarians

                    Twenty-five States had recently agreed with the idea of doing away with or tweaking the no-detention

                    Fall in global crude oil prices, has already eased the burden on the government.

                <li>
                    In the latest Union budget, the government allocated about ₹25,000 crore towards oil subsidy, which
                    is a fourth of the total oil subsidy bill (of almost ₹1 lakh crore) incurred in fiscal year 2013.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The implementation of the direct transfer of cash benefits has already helped in the better
                    targeting of subsidies to the poor, thus substantially reducing wasteful spending.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The cut in subsidy would further strengthen

                <li>
                    Sustainably lower the price of cooking gas once and for all, getting the government out of the

                </li>
                <li>
                    Deregulating the market for cooking gas, thus opening it up to more widespread market competition,

                    Some people feel that values keep changing with time and situation, while others strongly believe
                    that there are certain universal and eternal human values. Give your perception in this regard with
                    due justification.

                    You are recently posted as district development officer of a district. Shortly thereafter you found
                    that there is considerable tension in the rural areas of your district on the issue of sending girls
                    to schools.
                    <br/>
                    The elders of the village feel that many problems have come up because girls are being educated and
                    they are stepping out of the safe environment of the household. They are of the view that the girls
                    should be quickly married off with minimum education. The girls are also competing for jobs after
                    education, which have traditionally remained in boys’ exclusive domain, adding to unemployment
                    amongst male population.
                    <br/>
                    The younger generation feels that in the present era, girls should have equal opportunities for
                    education and employment, and other means of livelihood. The entire locality is divided between the
                    elders and the younger lot and further sub-divided between sexes in both generations. You come to
                    know that in Panchayat or in other local bodies or even in busy crossroads, the issue is being
                    acrimoniously debated.
                    <br/>
                    One day you are informed that an unpleasant incident has taken place. Some girls were molested, when
                    they were en route to schools. The incident led to clashes between several groups and a law and
                    order problem has arisen. The elders after heated discussion have taken a joint decision not to
                    allow girls to go to school and to socially boycott all such families, which do not follow their
                    dictate.

                            What steps would you take to ensure girls’ safety without disrupting their education?

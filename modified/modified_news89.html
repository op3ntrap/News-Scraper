                    have the potential to cause a powerful earthquake up to a magnitude of 8, triggering a tsunami

                    most large earthquakes which were caused when two plates collided at their boundaries and one plate
                    slid beneath the other.

                <li>
                    An order in the past led JMI to scrap reservations for SC/ST and OBC students and set aside half the

                    The university contends that it was set up by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan principally for minority uplift,
                    and therefore, it has to be seen to have a minority personality.

                    JMI, ironically, was created almost as the anti-thesis to Aligarh, when a group of scholars “walked

                    <li>
                        Sometimes it is caused when the brain’s own immune system mistakenly attacks brain tissue.

                    <li>
                        In rare cases, encephalitis is caused due to bacterial infection, parasites, or may be prompted

                The pronouncements by India and China that the Doklam military stand-off has come to an end signifies a

                The “expeditious disengagement of border personnel” shows the India’s policy of pursuing diplomatic
                measures in the face of China’s heated rhetoric was prudent.

                As the Iraqi war of 1991 began to descend, the spirit of history positioned the son of a small village
                near Azamgarh at the helm of the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi.

                The big new idea was called “strategic defiance”. When the United States turn inevitable, Pakistan would
                lead a battle on mid-sized powers like Iraq and Iran, helped by China.
            </li>
            <li>
                Presently President Donald Trump’s new South Asia doctrine is frightening Pakistan with severe effects.
                Henceforth should it fail to turn on its jihadist proxies, has made strategic defiance relevant again.

                General Pervez Musharraf was communicated that Pakistan would be bombed “back into the stone age” if the
                country did not desert its al Qaeda and Taliban proxies.
            </li>
            <li>
                Past records depict that each time the United States has slashed aid to Pakistan, geopolitical
                coincidence compelled it to reverse course.
            </li>
            <li>
                Aid dropped to near-zero levels after Pakistan’s nuclear-weapons programme in 1980.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 1990s saw a sharp reduction in aid after the anti-Soviet jihad ended and President George Bush
                refused to certify Pakistan did not possess nuclear weapons. Then, it surged after 9/11, rising to
                historic levels of $4.5 billion in 2010.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimates that over 68 per cent of Pakistan’s arms
                imports in 2012-2016 came from China.
            </li>
            <li>
                The United States has the capacity to target jihadist infrastructure and individuals deep inside
                Pakistan to unleash its Afghan allies’ covert assets to execute retaliatory terrorism in Pakistan.
            </li>
            <li>
                The end state of the Afghan war involves degrading the jihadist movement, not just a defined group of
                terrorists, thus denying space for great-power competitors to assert influence in a
                strategically-important region.
            </li>
            <li>
                Strategic defiance shows the defensive game well.

                Trump must beware the fact that a foul or two can go a long way in leveling the odds against superior

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The government should reform labour laws and make them more flexible to make it easier to do business in
                the country.
            </li>
            <li>
                More enterprises in labour-intensive sectors reported that finding skilled workers, hiring contract
                labour and terminating employees was a major or a severe obstacle.

                Pitched for accelerating power sector reforms to ensure that power-intensive enterprises have access to
                steady and uninterrupted power without undue delays or regulatory burden.
            </li>
            <li>
                Half of the enterprises do not borrow from financial institutions and about a third consider lack of
                access to finance as a major source of obstacles for business in the country

        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Recommendation
            </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                More flexible labour laws will allow enterprises to grow larger and reap economies of scale, generating
                productivity improvements, jobs creation and higher growth.
            </li>
            <li>
                If India is to enter the ‘double digit’ economic growth club, it will need to continually streamline and
                improve the business environment.

                Strong foreign inflows contributed to a rise by over $23 billion so far in the current financial year.
            </li>
            <li>
                A recent report by Edelweiss Securities Ltd stated that continuous interference by the RBI brought India
                close to getting in the currency maneuvering watch list of the US.
            </li>
            <li>
                The accommodative monetary policy in the developed world and the global financial system is flush with
                cheap money and investors are in a desperate search for yield.
            </li>
            <li>
                For example, $1 billion worth of bonds issued by the government of Iraq were oversubscribed and sold at
                a lower than expected yield.
            </li>
            <li>
                Rupee has been appreciated by about 6% since the beginning of this year, despite persistent intervention
                by the RBI
            </li>
            <li>
                Non-intervention or insufficient intervention would result in further appreciation of the rupee and
                affect India’s competitiveness.
            </li>
            <li>
                The external competitiveness is not exclusively dependent on the exchange rate. Therefore, there is no
                harm in suppressing volatility if possible, and giving businesses a more stable economic environment.
            </li>
            <li>
                The present liquidity situation is making things more difficult for the RBI.
            </li>
            <li>
                The banking system has excess liquidity of around Rs3 trillion and currency market intervention will
                increase this.
            </li>
            <li>
                Even though there is no imminent threat of high inflation, persistent surplus liquidity can affect
                monetary policy operations.
            </li>
            <li>
                The yields on foreign assets are much lower than government bonds and sterilized intervention is in
                effect a switch in central bank holdings from rupee to dollar securities.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>
                So how can the central bank deal with this problem of plenty?
            </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Work on government instrument like market stabilization scheme bonds and continue to build reserves.
            </li>
            <li>
                But, the cost would keep rising, as higher reserves would attract more flows, which will reduce the
                currency risk for foreign investors.
            </li>
            <li>
                The other option is to reassesses the kind of foreign funds it wants.
            </li>
            <li>
                India’s external debt is at about 20% of gross domestic product, and about 37% of this is commercial
                borrowing.
            </li>
            <li>
                Policy rationalization on this front can ease the pressure on both the RBI and the rupee.
            </li>

                            One of the most common form of viral encephalitis in Asia is the Japanese encephalitis virus
                            (JEV), caused by mosquito-borne flavivirus.

                            If we become fussy about ethical considerations, will it not hamper the economic progress of
                            our country? After all, in the present age of high competition, we cannot afford to be left
                            behind in the race of development.

                            It is understandable that we should not get involved in grossly unethical practices, but
                            giving and accepting small gratifications and doing small favours increases everybody’s
                            motivation. It also makes the system more efficient. What is wrong in adopting such
                            practices?

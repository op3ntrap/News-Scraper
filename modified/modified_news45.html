                        There are thin “filaments” that connect galaxies, forming a cosmic web, and there are large
                        voids in between.The current belief is that infant galaxies form in these filaments and then
                        drift to the intersections of the filaments where they grow.

                        Dark matter and dark energy are invoked to explain the structure of the universe. Dark matter,
                        being massive, binds together the universe while dark energy, exciting the surrounding space,
                        drives it apart; the balance of the two effects helps in maintaining the universe in its present
                        form.

                        something like 100 billion at a count. Galaxy groups can have three to 20 galaxies, the richest
                        systems are called clusters (like the Virgo cluster) which can have several hundred galaxies.

                        galaxies together with associated gas and dark matter. Large groups of such clusters, linked by
                        filaments, separated by voids together form the superclusters. Though initially a supercluster
                        was used to describe groups of two-four clusters, now it is understood that much larger
                        superclusters, comprising clusters that number an order of magnitude higher, exist. The first
                        such large supercluster to be discovered was the Shapley supercluster.

                        Spotting a supercluster which is 4000 million light years away means that you are looking at
                        light that has come in from four billion years ago. This is because a light year is the distance
                        travelled by light in one year. Since the universe is believed to be 13.8 billion years old,
                        this means we are looking at light from when the universe was about 10 billion years old, just
                        about 70% of its present age.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This poses a puzzle. According to present theories, it is difficult for such a huge galaxy to
                        have formed so early in the universe’s lifetime.

                        The vast chains of DNA in each cell are made of just four molecules — adenine, guanine, thymine
                        and cytosine — arranged in enormously varied configurations.

                        The geneticists ended up with a sequence of DNA molecules that represented the entirety of the

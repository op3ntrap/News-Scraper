                    Passive euthanasia, the act of withdrawing life support to a terminally-ill patient, is already the

                    </strong>
                    The government pointed out that the Supreme Court itself, in 2011, had issued comprehensive
                    guidelines allowing passive euthanasia in the tragic case of the bed-ridden former Mumbai nurse
                    Aruna Shanbaug.

                <li>
                    The government said it was finalising a draft law on passive euthanasia called
                    <strong>
                        ‘The Management of Patients With Terminal Illness – Withdrawal of Medical Life Support Bill’,
                    </strong>
                    which was drawn up in line with the recommendations of the Law Commission of India that life support
                    can be withdrawn for patients in
                    <strong>

                    The Centre, however, objected to legalising the
                    <strong>
                        concept of ‘Living Will’
                    </strong>
                    — an advance written directive to physicians for end-of-life medical care.
                    <br/>
                    Reason: this may lead to the abuse and neglect of the elderly, especially if they were financially
                    well-off. The government pointed out that the living will was a concept which contradicts a person’s
                    instinctive urge to survive.

                Forcing a person to take medical treatment against their will is also a social issue

                </li>
                <li>
                    This also raises a “philosophical question” on whether a person can refuse treatment

                    There are 75 stressed corporates who constitute 20 per cent of the total capital expenditure
                    spending over FY12-17.
                </li>
                <li>
                    These corporates are from key investment-linked sectors, such as metals and mining, infrastructure,
                    and power.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The majority of stressed corporates would require another 4-5 years to deleverage (the process of
                    reducing the level of one’s debt by rapidly selling one’s assets) to a sustainable level of 4-5
                    times from their current leverage of 9-10 times

                        Key Areas of Stresses:
                    </strong>
                    There are pockets of stress within sectors, especially infrastructure, metals and power
                    (particularly thermal) owing to high leverage and weak cash flow.
                </li>
                <li>
                    These sectors witnessed a significant decline in capacity utilisation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Corporates are likely to show an unwillingness to invest in long-term projects due to muted demand
                    and significant leverage, despite a low interest rate environment.

                <strong>
                    Way forward:
                </strong>
                The core sectors need to focus on selling stressed assets and equity infusion in order to make efforts
                in incurring capital expenditure.

                    <li>
                        The main issue is to do with the oversized fleet of Tamil Nadu trawlers that fish regularly in
                        Sri Lankan waters, often damaging the boats and gear of small-scale Tamil fishers from the
                        Northern Province of Sri Lanka.

                    <li>
                        The Sri Lankan government has not only passed a legislation banning trawling but its navy has

                    <li>
                        The plan is to remove as many trawl vessels from the Palk Bay as possible. And replace them with
                        deep sea vessels that fish in the Bay of Bengal and Gulf of Mannar, in 2017-2020.

                    <li>
                        The plan in the Palk Bay is to extract 2,000 trawlers from the bay. Each vessel will cost Rs 80
                        lakhs of which only 30 per cent (10% upfront+ 20% loan) is to be paid by the trawl owners, while
                        rest will be paid by state and central government as subsidy.

                        The government is now creating a new deep-sea fishing harbour at Mookaiyur, located just south

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        There is a question whether there are sufficient stocks of fish in the adjacent waters of the
                        Bay of Bengal and Gulf of Mannar to make deep sea fishing economically viable for a large and
                        new fleet of vessels.

                    <li>
                        Are the trawl owners interested: do Palk Bay trawl fishers, who are used to one-day fishing,
                        have sufficient skills and an interest for deep sea fishing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The question of what will become of trawl crews (who might not have the required skills for deep
                        sea fishing) remains largely unaddressed, potentially jeopardising the local economy of the
                        region.

                    <li>
                        The main concern for the trawl owners is whether deep sea fishing is a sound investment or not.

                    <li>
                        Some fishermen have doubts about the high operational costs of deep sea fishing and the loan
                        repayment schedule.

                    <li>
                        Equally of concern is the Tamil Nadu Fisheries Department’s capacity to monitor, control and
                        carry out surveillance (MCS) of the process of decommissioning.

                    <li>
                        Whether deep sea fishing will reduce the Palk Bay fishing conflict depends entirely on the
                        downsizing of the existing trawl fleet. This means actual implementation of rules on the ground
                        is the most important thing to look into.

                        Various other solutions such as buy-backs, alternative livelihoods and skill development need to
                        be rolled out with a simultaneous focus on a strong MCS system. Only then can this intransigent

                <li>
                    To address high levels of stress faced by the banking sector at the time.

                <li>
                    Previously in the month of June, The RBI had identified 12 ‘defaulters’ who account for around 25%
                    of India’s
                    <strong>
                        non-performing assets (NPA)

                    and informed banks to take up insolvency proceedings against them.

                <li>
                    Steel, Infrastructure, Power and Textiles are the sectors with the most NPAs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Public sector banks were hit the most as large modern and foundation programs were bolstered by them
                    with the expectation that there would be further extension.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    What does the Bill do?
                </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>

                    It empowers RBI to give directions to banks to act against loan defaulters.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Bill seeks to amend
                    <strong>
                        the Banking Regulation Act, 1949
                    </strong>
                    by inserting provisions for handling cases related to stressed assets.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stressed assets are loans on which the borrower has defaulted or it has been restructured.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Central Government can authorise the RBI to issue directions to banks for initiating proceedings
                    in case of a default in loan repayment. These proceedings would be under the Insolvency and
                    Bankruptcy Code, 2016.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The RBI may also form committees to advise banks on the resolution of stressed assets. The members
                    will be appointed or approved by the RBI.

                    In the IoT-enabled remote scanning, if the scans are uploaded to the cloud without being first
                    analysed, there is a possibility that the doctor sees a huge amount of data, which they may find
                    difficult to interpret.

                    There is a disaster-prone State having frequent landslides, forest fires, cloudbursts, flash floods
                    and earthquakes, etc. Some of these are seasonal and often unpredictable. The magnitude of the
                    disaster is always unanticipated. During one of the seasons, a cloudburst caused devastating floods
                    and landslides leading to high casualties. There was major damage to infrastructure like roads,
                    bridges and power generating units. This led to more than 100000 pilgrims, tourists and other locals
                    trapped across different routes and locations. The people trapped in your area of responsibility
                    included senior citizens, patients in hospitals, women and children, hikers, tourists, ruling
                    party’s regional president along with his family, additional jail. As secretary State and prisoners
                    in jail.
                    <br/>
                    As a civil services officer of the State, what would be the order in which you would rescue these
                    people and why? Give justifications.

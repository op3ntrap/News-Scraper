            <ul>

                    Spain said it will move to seize some of the Catalan regional government’s powers after its leader
                    warned that he could declare independence, escalating the country’s worst political crisis in
                    decades.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The central government in Madrid had given separatist leader Carles Puigdemont time until 10:00 am
                    to say whether or not he was declaring a breakaway state in the semi-autonomous region following a
                    chaotic referendum on October 1.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Prime Minister of Spain had warned he would trigger Article 155 of Spain’s Constitution a never
                    before used measure allowing it to impose direct rule over the wealthy northeastern region unless
                    Mr. Puigdemont backed down.
                </li>

            <p>
                <strong>
                    Impact of this decision:
                </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    There are fears that such a move, allowing Madrid to potentially suspend Mr. Puigdemont’s government
                    and take over its police force, could spark unrest in a region where even Catalans who oppose
                    independence cherish their autonomy highly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The separatist leader responded that Catalan lawmakers could vote to declare secession unilaterally
                    if Madrid triggers Article 155.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Article 155 a process that would take several days to restore legality in the region.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Catalonia crisis has prompted a series of huge street rallies, worried investors and added to
                    the woes of a European Union already grappling with Brexit.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Catalonia’s 7.5 million residents are fiercely attached to their own language and culture but are
                    divided on whether to break away from the rest of Spain.
                </li>
                <li>
                    But according to the separatist leader his regional administration has a mandate to declare
                    independence from what he says was a 90% “Yes” vote on October 1.
                </li>
                <li>
                    But turnout was given as only 43%.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Many voters who oppose independence stayed away from a referendum that had been declared illegal by
                Spain’s Constitutional Court.

                    The PTFE is mostly used as a non-stick coating for utensils. The department has stated that the

                    128.1% for India.

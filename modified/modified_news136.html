                    it is very doubtful whether the emotional bond can be established in a virtual meeting during video

                    matrimonial disputes should be conducted in camera in the spirit of Section 11 of the Family Courts
                    Act of 1984 and video conferencing would destroy the privacy of the proceedings and probably defeat

                <li>
                    The majority judgment set aside a decision by a two-judge Bench of the Supreme Court, directing all
                    high courts to issue administrative instructions to family courts across the country to open video
                    conferencing facilities and use the technology to conduct marital disputes whenever one of the

                    It obtained responses on household perceptions and expectations on the general economic situation,

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The survey indicated that more people see consumer confidence declining, business sentiment in
                    manufacturing dipping, inflation on the rise and growth sliding.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There are two sub-indices in the survey- Current Situation Index (CSI) and Future Expectations Index
                    (FEI)
                </li>
                <li>
                    The CSI slipped further into the pessimistic zone, reflecting deterioration in sentiments on the
                    employment scenario, the price level and income. Same was the case with the FEI which slipped
                    relative to its previous reading in June 2017.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There are five main variables in the survey on which responses from public were sought. These are
                    Economic situation, Income, Spending, Employment and Price level.
                </li>
                <li>
                    7 per cent of respondents say the economic situation has worsened in September 2017 as against 25.3
                    per cent in the same period last year. The response for “one year ahead expectation” shows a decline
                    to 50.8 per cent on the issue of economy “will improve” — down from 66.3 per cent in December 2016.
                    The response for the current perception on the general economic situation showed 34.6 per cent
                    saying “improved” as of September 2017, down from 44.6 per cent in September 2016.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Employment prospects have been the biggest cause of worry for respondents. 7 per cent of respondents
                    believed current perception about employment has “worsened”, which is much higher than the 31.4 per
                    cent in November 2016.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The perception of people on income levels has also come down to 26.6 per cent in September 2017 from
                    37.3 per cent in November 2016
                </li>
                <li>
                    Despite gloomy sentiment on income, more than 80 per cent of respondents reported increased spending
                    over the past year, which could partly be attributed to higher prices.

            </p>
            <p>
                You are recently posted as district development officer of a district. Shortly thereafter you found that
                there is considerable tension in the rural areas of your district on the issue of sending girls to
                schools.
            </p>
            <p>
                The elders of the village feel that many problems have come up because girls are being educated and they
                are stepping out of the safe environment of the household. They are of the view that the girls should be
                quickly married off with minimum education. The girls are also competing for jobs after education, which
                have traditionally remained in boys’ exclusive domain, adding to unemployment amongst male population.
            </p>
            <p>
                The younger generation feels that in the present era, girls should have equal opportunities for
                education and employment, and other means of livelihood. The entire locality is divided between the
                elders and the younger lot and further sub-divided between sexes in both generations. You come to know
                that in Panchayat or in other local bodies or even in busy crossroads, the issue is being acrimoniously
                debated.
            </p>
            <p>
                One day you are informed that an unpleasant incident has taken place. Some girls were molested, when
                they were en route to schools. The incident led to clashes between several groups and a law and order
                problem has arisen. The elders after heated discussion have taken a joint decision not to allow girls to

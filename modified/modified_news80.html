                <li>
                    A deeper cut in the interest rates would be warranted, given that current inflation at 1.5% is
                    running well below the 4% target.

                    However, export competitiveness needs interventions which go beyond dependence on the exchange rate

                    The Government has recently announced that only electric vehicles (EVs) will be sold in India from

                </li>
                <li>
                    The current National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) has set a sales target of only 5-7

                <li>
                    Replacing these with EVs would require a significant push as far as vehicle-charging infrastructure

                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    It is equivalent to increasing the current global EV battery production by a factor of five, just to

                    95% of global lithium production comes from Argentina, Australia, Chile and China

                <li>
                    The recent demand surge in the electric mobility market has already resulted in a twofold increase

                    It is estimated by the CEEW that India would require about 40,000 tonnes of lithium to manufacture

                    It is important that India secure mineral supplies for its domestic industry by acquisition of

                                It is seen as part of India’s larger strategic move to wean Dhaka away from China, the
                                biggest supplier of defence equipment to Bangladesh for many years now.

                                The signing of the third line of credit agreement will enable the implementation of 17

                                provided at a concessional interest rate of 1% per annum, with repayment over a period
                                of 20 years including a five-year moratorium.

                        China has been making inroads into countries in India’s neighbourhood—with major infrastructure
                        projects, development aid and financial assistance.

                        India’s ties with Bangladesh have improved dramatically in recent years after India signed the
                        land boundary agreement in June 2015—hanging fire since 1974. The conclusion of the pact was
                        seen as a major confidence-building measure between the two neighbours.

                    <li>
                        India sees Bangladesh and Myanmar as important neighbours, sharing borders with both countries.
                        Insurgents operating in India’s northeast have taken shelter in both countries in the past,
                        using bases there for hit-and-run operations. India has viewed with concern increasing Chinese
                        aid and infrastructure assistance to both countries—fearing a heightening of Beijing’s profile
                        and a waning of its own influence in its periphery.

                        Even if the deal collapses Iran is unlikely to expel inspectors (inspecting its nuclear
                        reactors) entirely, as it did in 1997, or pull out of Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
                        This is because such actions would undercut Iran’s profession of peaceful intent and it stands
                        to lose the moral high ground.

                        It is difficult to gauge the future path of Iran’s segmented leadership which is divided between
                        an elected president and an autocratic supreme leader.

                        Iran’s Shia militia could unleash war against US troops in Iraq and expand support to Afghan

                        Tehran would have to have to balance the support it has garnered from the Europe while
                        bargaining with the US, such that it would not provoke Europeans into siding, reluctantly, with
                        Washington, and that it may push the U.S., Israel, or both, into a preventive war.

                        In short, it would be virtually impossible to rebuild today the broad, multinational sanctions
                        regime that helped push Iran to the negotiating table during 2013-15. Hence, it is better to
                        persuade Iran that its economic integration into the world economy could continue regardless and
                        therefore it should abide by the deal.

                        The US must not risk its diplomatic credibility and push the West Asian region into spate of war
                        which is still trying to recover from the gradual fall of the ISIS.

                                    RBI introduced MCLR on April 1, 2016 after finding that the then prevailing base
                                    rate had failed to achieve the objectives of easier and faster policy transmission.

                                    The MCLR was introduced to calculate the benchmark lending rate in another attempt
                                    to make banks pass on policy rate cut benefits to borrowers quickly and in a more
                                    transparent manner

                                    MCLR is calculated after factoring in banks’ marginal cost of funds (largely, the
                                    interest at which they borrow money), return on equity (a measure of banks’
                                    profitability), and negative carry on account of cash reserve ratio.

                                    Before the MCLR was rolled out, the banks were following a more rigid base rate
                                    system, which came into force on July 1, 2010 replacing the banks’ prime lending
                                    rate.
                                </li>

                                    Under the base rate and BPLR, banks were following individual methodologies for
                                    computing the minimum rate at which they could lend. Under the MCLR, RBI asked all
                                    banks to follow the marginal cost of funds method to arrive at their benchmark
                                    lending rate

                            Draft Energy Policy
                        </strong>
                        (DNEP) predicts that between 2017 and 2040, there will be a quantum leap in the uptake of
                        renewable energy together with a drastic reduction in fossil fuel energy intensity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        With economic and population growth, India’s annual per-capita electricity consumption is
                        expected to triple, from 1075 kWh in 2015-16 to over 2900 kWh in 2040.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The DNEP assumes 100% electrification throughout India in the near term
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The government will invest $2.5 billion to provide electricity connections to every home in
                        India by the end of 2018.

                    <li>
                        But the DNEP fails to consider several critical issues involved in the ongoing energy
                        transition.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Drawback of DNEP
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Despite the fact that existing coal plants are running at low efficiencies (at merely 60% plant
                        load capacity utilization) because of weak industrial growth in last 3 years, the DNEP relies on
                        coal power to sustain the nation’s base load requirement to meet rising energy demand.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It proposes that coal will fuel 67% of India’s power generation in 2022.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It is contrary to the India’s claim that it will make a big push for renewables, it will
                        continue to rely on coal for its baseload generation. While renewables grow, coal power grows
                        too.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This duality is possible because India did not commit to any actual reductions in its greenhouse
                        gas emissions at the Paris climate meeting in 2015.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Even this target India will need only 741 million tonnes of coal by 2022 however the Ministry of
                        Coal has ambitious target of 1.5 billion tonnes by 2020.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The DNEP is silent on the fate of the new allottes of coal mines. The concern is what would they
                        do with their coal if they can’t generate power with it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Generation of power is licence free under the Electricity Act of 2003, so private miners do not
                        need any licence to set up generating plants. All they need is a connection to the grid. Since
                        the grid is State-owned, the Central government has adequate leverage to defer or delay
                        connections.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The DNEP acknowledges increased oil and gas consumption in India decreased refining of oil and
                        production of gas.Thus, India’s energy security does require a large strategic storage of oil to
                        contain any vagaries in international supply chain.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        But this strategic storage of oil does not tackle the systemic causes of this high dependence on
                        oil.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The peaking of India’s oil demand could have been envisaged but has not been identified in the
                        DNEP. But it recognises that by 2040, India’s oil import dependence may reach 55% from the
                        current level of 33%. To curtail this import dependence DNEP promotes use of public
                        transportation and railways to reduce oil consumption.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Unless electric transport is carefully planned, India’s dependence on imported oil is likely to
                        continue.

                    <li>
                        The drafting committees need to examine the paradigm shifts occurring in storage and electric
                        vehicles to promote new technologies in renewable energy, such as smart grids, smart homes,
                        battery storage and concentrated solar heat and power.

                    <li>
                        New institutions, organisations and funding mechanisms for promoting renewable technologies need
                        to be created not later than this year’s end.

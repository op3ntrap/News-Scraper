                    The Union government has dropped plans to

                    The Wages Code Bill was drafted under an exercise to rationalise the country’s 44 labour laws into
                    four codes covering all the regulations pertaining to wages, industrial relations, social security
                    and safety, and health and working conditions.

                        Labour Ministry’s proposal:
                    </strong>
                    proposed inserting clauses for recognising the rights of transgender workers in all the four labour

                    </strong>
                    the Law Ministry objected, citing the
                    <strong>
                        General Clauses Act of 1897
                    </strong>
                    , according to which ‘transgenders’ fall within the definition of ‘person’. It was then decided that
                    there was no need to add a separate clause for them.

                    Dropping the separate clauses protecting transgender persons is a hypocritical move by the Union
                    government, as it is well known that we face discrimination at the workplace.

                <li>
                    The dignity of our body needs to be protected at the workplace as well, with basic facilities such

                            The hydrogen bomb, also called a thermonuclear bomb, uses fusion – or atomic nuclei coming
                            together – to produce explosive energy. Stars also produce energy through Atomic fusion.

                            Atomic bombs rely on fission, or atom-splitting, just as nuclear power plants do.

                            The technology of the hydrogen bomb is more sophisticated, and once attained, it is a
                            greater threat. It can also be made small enough to fit on a head of an ICBM.

                    Various governments has highlighted the need for large-sized banks to fund the huge infrastructure
                    requirements of the country as well as compete with global lenders

                    <strong>
                        But a serious question arises:
                    </strong>
                    ‘Which chief executive will propose to merge his bank with another and lose his job?’

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Present government has no intention to make it ‘voluntary’ for the board of a bank to decide on a
                    merger
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is evident from the fact that government has wrote letters to banks to kick start the process of
                    mergers and get their respective boards’ approval
                </li>
                <li>
                    This may be the first time in recent history that an official communication has been made by the
                    government to the banks asking them to act on mergers

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The government has also set up an ‘Alternative Mechanism’
                </li>
                <li>
                    It would comprise a ministerial group, to oversee proposals for mergers among banks
                </li>
                <li>
                    A framework had been conceived in which a bank’s board would first clear the decision to merge
                </li>
                <li>
                    And then send the proposal to the ‘Alternative Mechanism’ for its in-principle approval
                </li>
                <li>
                    After the in-principle approval comes through, the bank will take steps in accordance with law and
                    SEBI’s requirements
                </li>
                <li>
                    The final scheme will be notified by the government in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India

                <li>

                <li>
                    The merger would create a lot of complexities in terms of branch rationalisation and reduction in

                <li>

                    Also, after its merger, SBI has seen NPAs rising significantly, from Rs. 1.01 lakh crore (6.94%) to

                <li>
                    While it may be difficult to put a price tag on nature, unchecked exploitation of scarce natural
                    resources and an inadequate response to India’s unique climate challenges can be a very costly

                    </strong>
                    Air pollution is diminishing India’s capacity to harness power from the sun.

                        New study by Scientists:
                    </strong>
                    S. and Indian scientists measured how man-made particles floating in the air and deposited as grime
                    on solar panels combined to seriously impair sunlight from converting to energy.

                    Sand and dust that sickens millions across India every year is also sapping solar power generation
                    by more than 25 percent.

                    At present levels in India, it could amount to roughly 3,900 MW of lost energy — six times the
                    capacity of its largest solar farm, a gigantic field of 2.5 million panels.

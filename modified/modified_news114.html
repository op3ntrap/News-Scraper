                                Although nascent in India and not significant in value yet, the potential benefits that
                                P2P lending promises to various stakeholders (borrowers, lenders, agencies etc.) and its
                                associated risks to the financial system are too important to be ignored.

                                P2P lending promotes alternative forms of finance, where formal finance is unable to
                                reach and also has the potential to soften the lending rates as a result of lower
                                operational costs and enhanced competition with the traditional lending channels. If
                                properly regulated, P2P lending platforms can do this more effectively

                                According to RBI, P2P lending is a form of crowd funding used to raise loans which are
                                paid back with interest.It can be defined as the use of an online platform that matches
                                lenders with borrowers in order to provide unsecured loans.

                                The survey talks about the “social cost” of renewable energy in comparison to that of

                                Besides other cost parameters, including health and environmental costs, the survey
                                includes “the opportunity cost of stranded conventional power assets” as one of the
                                components of the social cost.

                                The losses incurred by investors and lenders due to the underutilization of coal power
                                plants becomes the most significant contributor to renewable energy’s social cost,
                                making it three time more expensive than conventional power.

                                According to Central Electricity Authority, the share of renewable electricity in
                                India’s total electricity generation was around 7.6% between April 2016 and March 2017.
                                So how can this be the reason for below-par plant load factors of coal power plants?

                                By the same logic, no disruptive transition to better and more efficient technologies
                                would ever be possible because during the transition stage, the older assets are bound
                                to be underutilized or in a sense, financially stranded. Examples- UJALA, or Unnat Jyoti
                                by Affordable Lighting for All, scheme that aims to promote efficient use of energy.
                                This whole UJALA campaign must also be rendering manufacturers of incandescent lamps in
                                a state of financial stress, so is that being factored in while estimating the social
                                cost of LED lamps? The same also goes for electrical vehicles that surely would result
                                in the supply chain of conventional automobile components becoming stranded assets?

                                And how transparently does this “social cost” dispensation take into account the cost of

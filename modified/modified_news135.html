                        per se is not a sovereign country but a group of sovereign countries. Such a mention is more
                        notable this time in light of the U.S.’s uncertain position on the international stage and EU’s
                        need for a stronger union post Brexit.

                        EU is India’s largest trade partner (over 100 billion Euros in bilateral trade of goods and
                        services last year). EU, like India, is also wary of China’s political and economic dominance.

                        India is right to strike a hard bargain as far as the temporary movement of skilled workers is
                        concerned. The EU and other developed countries have been historically reluctant about moving
                        forward on this and the issue has become more challenging with the rise of populism and
                        protectionism in Europe.

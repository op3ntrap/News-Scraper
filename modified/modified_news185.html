                    The Commission in its report had said that ‘

                    </strong>
                    as a subject was not specifically listed in any of the three Lists, i.e. the Union, the State or the

                    and under the Emergency Provisions in Part XVIII of the Constitution has been assigned to the Union
                    Government. Though it is an overriding executive power of the Union, in Constitutional practice,
                    however, ‘Security’ is a subject in which the States and the Union have a common interest and are
                    expected to act in a co-ordinated manner.

                    The Commission also said that in case of communal riots, which has a potential of causing widespread
                    violence within a territory, “the use of

                    may be in order.” “A clarificatory line in this, regard, if required, may be inserted making the
                    provision explicitly clear that the Centre can depute Paramilitary Forces to such trouble spots in
                    exceptional circumstances even if a request from the State Government is not received. The aim has
                    to be to ensure quick control of the situation, bring it back to normal, hand over the area to the
                    local administration as quickly as possible and then withdraw the Central forces.

                    RBI study reveals: “fundamental shift” in the payment habits in the economy-a move away from cash
                    payments to and a wider adoption of retail electronic payments, card usage at merchant terminals and
                    cheques.

                <li>
                    The demonetisation has impacted the inter-bank payments and settlement system significantly in
                    moving cash transactions to non-cash modes of payments in three segments- retail electronic
                    payments, card usage at PoS terminals and cheques.

                <li>
                    As per the study, cheque volumes and values contracted during the pre-demonetisation period but
                    recorded positive growth during demonetisation as well as post-note-ban months.

                <li>
                    There was a sharp growth in card transactions at points of sale terminals for both demonetisation

                        You are the manager of a spare parts company A and you have to negotiate a deal with the manager
                        of a large manufacturing company B. The deal is highly competitive and sealing the deal is
                        critical for your company. The deal is being worked out over a dinner. After dinner the manager
                        of manufacturing company B offered to drop you to the hotel in his car. On the way to hotel he
                        happens to hit motorcycle injuring the motorcyclist badly. You know the manager was driving fast
                        and thus lost control. The law enforcement officer comes to investigate the issue and you are
                        the sole eyewitness to it. Knowing the strict laws pertaining to road accidents you are aware
                        that your honest account of the incident would lead to the prosecution of the manager and as a
                        consequence the deal is likely to be jeopardized, which is of immense importance to your
                        company.

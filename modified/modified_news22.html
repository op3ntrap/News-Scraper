                            </strong>
                            Out of the 26 million births that occur in India every year, approximately 2-3% had severe
                            congenital or chromosomal abnormality
                        </p>
                        <pre><strong>Basic Information:



</strong><strong>What is MTP Act, 1971?

</strong>Abortion in India is legal only up to twenty weeks of pregnancy under specific conditions 

and situations.

One, the continuance of the pregnancy would involve a risk to the life of the 

pregnant woman or of grave injury of physical or mental health, or

Two, there is a substantial risk that if the child were born, it would suffer 

from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped.



<strong>What the draft MPT bill 2014 provides?

</strong>The draft MTP increased the legal limit for abortion from 20 weeks to 24 weeks.

It provides for abortion beyond 24 weeks under defined conditions.

The Bill amends Section 3 of the 1971 Act to provide that “the length of pregnancy shall 

not apply” in a decision to abort a foetus diagnosed with “substantial foetal abnormalities” 

or if it is “alleged by the pregnant woman to have been caused by rape”.

Under the 1971 Act, even pregnant rape victims cannot abort after 20 weeks, compelling 

them to move court.

It allows a woman to take an independent decision in consultation with a registered 

health-care provider.

It also takes into account the reality of a massive shortage of both doctors and 

trained midwives, and seeks to allow Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha practitioners to carry 

out abortions.<strong> 



</strong><strong>Why is it essential to change the MTP law?

</strong>Foetal abnormalities show up only by 18 weeks, so just a two-week window after 

that is too small for the would-be parents to take the difficult call on whether to 

keep their baby.

Even for the medical practitioner, this window is too small to exhaust all possible 

options before advising the patient.

There is an urgent need to empower women with sexual rights, legal protection against 

sex crimes and sex choices both in their own interest and for the sake of reducing the 

fertility rate as a whole.

The lack of legal approval moves abortion to underground and they are done in 

unhygienic conditions by untrained, thus, putting thousands of women at risk.</pre>

                                In an e-mail last year to the joint secretary, health ministry, the DGCI pitched for
                                “vegetable capsules for vegetarian society”

                                She argued, “In a country where there are millions of people, this hurts religious
                                sentiments and many people avoid medicines that are in a capsule form”

                                The Drug Technical Advisory Board, health ministry’s premier advisory agency, had
                                dismissed Gandhi’s representation on the grounds that: “Unlike food, drugs are not taken
                                as choice but are prescribed by doctors to save lives and marking them as vegetarian or
                                non-vegetarian is not desirable”

</strong><strong>Kepler Mission

</strong>Kepler is a space observatory launched by NASA to discover Earth-size planets 

orbiting other stars

Named after astronomer Johannes Kepler

It was launched into an Earth-trailing heliocentric orbit

Kepler is part of NASA’s Discovery Program of relatively low-cost, focused primary 

science missions

The scientific objective of Kepler is to explore the structure and diversity of 

planetary systems

<strong>This spacecraft observes:

</strong>To determine how many Earth-size and larger planets there are in or near the habitable 

zone <strong>(often called “Goldilocks planets”)

</strong>To determine the range of size and shape of the orbits of these planets

To estimate how many planets there are in multiple-star systems

To determine the range of orbit size, brightness, size, mass and density of short-period 

giant planets

To identify additional members of each discovered planetary system using other techniques

Determine the properties of those stars that harbor planetary systems</pre>

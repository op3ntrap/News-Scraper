                    <li>
                        The collegium has been firm that the Centre must put in writing its objections, including on

                        subsidy amount is directly transferred to beneficiary accounts, in this case the subsidy will go
                        to the manufacturer or marketing firm.

                        buyers’ Aadhaar cards. As the farmer buys, the difference between market rate and the subsidised
                        amount will be credited to the bank account of the manufacturer or the marketing company

                            The PM in 2014 enunciated the concept of SMART police. The smartness has two dimensions
                            external and internal.

                                External Dimension
                            </strong>
                            refers to the uniform a policeman wears, the way he carries himself, his weapons, the
                            communication equipment on his person, his mobility, response time, et al. The scheme would
                            enhance his capabilities to respond to and deal with the kind of challenges he is confronted
                            with in his day to day work.

                                Internal Dimension
                            </strong>
                            refers to the expanded acronym of SMART that is, the police should be strict and sensitive,
                            modern and mobile, alert and accountable, reliable and responsible, tech-savvy and trained.
                            This is far more important than the external dimension but the scheme hardly improves this
                            aspect.

                            It is the state of mind which matters. And to achieve that state of mind, police must be
                            freed from the stranglehold of politicians.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The scheme must be followed by structural reforms, institutions like the state security
                            commission, police establishment board and complaints authority must be set up in every
                            state in keeping with the directions of the Court.

                        <li>
                            The GOI should bring police and public order in the Concurrent List of Schedule VII of the
                            Constitution. Constitutional experts like Fali S. Nariman have strongly spoken in favour of
                            such an amendment.

                            treating waste. “Centre gives only 35% of expenses for the entire solid waste management

                        living in the vicinity of Berne, Indiana, appears to protect against multiple aspects of
                        biological ageing in humans.

                    <li>
                        Indiana Amish kindred with the mutation live more than 10 per cent longer and have 10 per cent
                        longer telomeres (a protective cap at the end of our chromosomes that is a biological marker of
                        ageing) compared to Amish kindred members who do not have the mutation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Amish with this mutation also have significantly less diabetes and lower fasting insulin levels.

                    <li>
                        A composite measure that reflects vascular age also is lower — indicative of retained
                        flexibility in blood vessels in the carriers of the mutation — than those who do not have the
                        mutation, the research also found.

                        These Amish individuals have very low levels of PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor), a
                        protein that comprises part of a “molecular fingerprint” related to ageing or senescence of
                        cells.It was previously known that PAI-1 was related to ageing in animals but unclear how it
                        affected ageing in humans.

                        The Amish kindred in Berne, Indiana, have been genetically and culturally isolated and most are
                        at least distantly related.

                    <li>
                        The ancestors of the Indiana Amish emigrated in the middle of the 19th century from Berne,
                        Switzerland.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The mutation was introduced into the Amish kindred by farmers from Switzerland, who moved into
                        the area.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Two of their descendants, who carried the mutation, married into the Amish community. The Amish
                        community outside the Berne area does not carry this mutation.

                        People with the mutation live to be 85 on average, significantly longer than their predicted
                        average lifespan of 71 for Amish in general and which has not changed much over the last
                        century.

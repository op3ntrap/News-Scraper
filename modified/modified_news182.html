                    The Union government has set up a ministerial committee to frame a new law that would attract penal

                        of triple talaq or talaq-e-biddat

                    The Supreme Court had, in August this year, in a majority judgement set aside the practice of
                    talaq-e-biddat, an arbitrary and unilateral decision by a Muslim husband to end the marriage by
                    utterance of the word talaq three times.

                            (UN). Seated in the Peace Palace in The Hague, Netherlands, the court settles legal disputes
                            submitted to it by states and provides advisory opinions on legal questions submitted to it
                            by duly authorized international branches, agencies, and the UN General Assembly.

                            staggered, with five judges elected every three years to ensure continuity within the court.
                            Should a judge die in office, the practice has generally been to elect a judge in a special
                            election to complete the term.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Amnesty International said that Myanmar’s persecution of Rohingya Muslims fits the legal definition
                    of apartheid, a crime against humanity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a report based on a two-year investigation, the group said that Rohingya, a mostly stateless
                    minority from Myanmar’s western state of Rakhine, are “trapped in a vicious system of
                    state-sponsored, institutionalized discrimination.”
                </li>
                <li>
                    Amnesty traces the roots of the crisis to systemic discrimination and segregation that has
                    intensified dramatically since 2012, when deadly riots erupted between Buddhists and Muslims in
                    several parts of the state. Buddhists make up the majority in both Rakhine state and in the country
                    at large.

                        Apartheid was a system of institutionalised racial segregation and discrimination in South
                        Africa between 1948 and 1991.Broadly speaking, apartheid was delineated into petty apartheid,
                        which entailed the segregation of public facilities and social events, and grand apartheid,
                        which dictated housing and employment opportunities by race

                    The refugee crisis erupted after the military launched a brutal counter-insurgency operations

                    Myanmar’s military has said that all fighting against the Rohingya Islamist militants died out on

                <li>
                    The group behind those attacks, Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), had declared a one-month
                    ceasefire on Sept.10, which was rejected by the government. But there have been no serious clashes

                    The United States and other Western countries have become more engaged with Myanmar since it began a
                    transition to civilian government after nearly 50 years of military rule.

                <li>
                    China has close relations with both Myanmar and Bangladesh, and has long been a key player in
                    lawless borderlands where rebel ethnic groups have fought Myanmar’s government for decades.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The conflict in those border regions have occasionally pushed thousands of refugees to seek shelter

                    The international community and the United Nations Security Council are expected to give

                A kanger is an earthen pot woven around with wicker filled with hot embers used by Kashmiris and
                Himachalis beneath their traditional clothing to keep the chill at bay, which is also regarded as a work
                of art. In Kashmir, it is normally kept inside the Phiran, the Kashmiri cloak, or inside a blanket. If a
                person is wearing a jacket, it may be used as a hand warmer.

                It is generally believed that Kashmiris learnt the use of the kangri from the Italians who were in the
                retinue of the Mughal emperors, and usually visited the Valley during summer. In Italy (where a similar
                device was known as a scaldino) and Spain, braziers were made in a great variety of shapes and were
                profusely ornamented. Historical data, however, contradicts the claim that kangri came to Kashmir from
                Italy, but it is known that it was used in the time of the Mughal Empire. Those visiting Kashmir for the
                first time during the winter season are surprised to find people carrying firepots in their hands or in
                their laps but every Kashmiri know how to handle the apparatus with care. It is a part of Kashmiri
                tradition and even in modern times it sees a huge demand, and is even used in public or private offices
                during winters.

                        You are a Public Information Officer (PIO) in a government department. You are aware that the
                        RTI Act 2005 envisages transparency and accountability in administration. The act has functioned
                        as a check on the supposedly arbitrarily administrative behaviour and actions. However, as a PIO
                        you have observed that there are citizens who filed RTI applications not for themselves but on
                        behalf of such stakeholders who purportedly want to have access to information to further their
                        own interests. At the same time there are these RTI activists who routinely file RTI
                        applications and attempt to extort money from the decision makers. This type of RTI activism has
                        affected the functioning of the administration adversely and also possibly jeopardises the
                        genuineness of the applications which are essentially aimed at getting justice.

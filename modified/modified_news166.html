                        The Union government has proposed to establish commercial courts in districts to further improve
                        the parameters.

                    <li>
                        The government is proposing amendments to facilitate the establishment of commercial courts, at
                        the district level, in places where the High Courts have ordinary original civil jurisdiction.

                        Legal remedy to commercial disputes and enforcement of business contracts are parameters of the

                        In terms of ease of enforcing contracts, India jumped from 172 to 164.

                        is not aimed at China and would “comply with the trend of times” which it identified as peace,
                        development, and cooperation.

                        Washington was keen to have India, Japan, and Australia on board for a “productive” engagement,
                        while Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is likely to propose the same arrangement between the
                        four powers when President Donald Trump visits Tokyo on Monday.

                    <li>
                        India has responded positively to the proposal, saying it has “an open mind to cooperate with

                        The Goods and Services Tax Council may consider lowering tax rates on goods such as handmade

                        The Council, headed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, will meet on November 10 to consider

                    <li>
                        The panel is likely to rationalise the tax rate in sectors where the total incidence of taxation
                        has gone up because the goods were earlier either exempt from excise or attracted lower VAT
                        rates in the previous indirect tax regime.

                        The famous Banaganapalle mangoes of Andhra Pradesh and Tulaipanji rice of West Bengal are among
                        the seven commodities that have been granted Geographical Indication (GI) this fiscal year by
                        the Indian patent office.

                        The other five products which have received the GI tag this year include Pochampally Ikat of

                        A GI is primarily an agricultural, natural or a manufactured product (handicrafts and industrial
                        goods) originating from a definite geographical territory.

                        Typically, such a name conveys an assurance of quality and distinctiveness, which is essentially
                        attributable to the place of its origin.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Darjeeling tea, Tirupati laddu, Kangra paintings, Nagpur orange and Kashmir pashmina are among
                        the registered GIs in India.

                    <li>
                        This tag gave protection to the producer of these genuine products, which commanded premium
                        pricing in the markets, both domestic and international.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once the GI protection is granted, no other producer can misuse the name to market similar
                        products. It also provides comfort to customers about the authenticity of that product

                        The Navy is likely to go with an advanced
                        <strong>
                            catapult-based aircraft launch mechanism (CATOBAR)
                        </strong>
                        from the U.S. for its second indigenous aircraft carrier (IAC-II), which is on the drawing
                        board.

                    <li>
                        For some time, India has been exploring the possibility of installing the U.S. electromagnetic
                        aircraft launch system (EMALS).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        While the older generation of CATOBAR was powered by a steam catapult, EMALS uses an electric
                        motor-driven catapult instead, which allows the launch of much heavier aircraft and also reduces
                        the stress on the aircraft.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        EMALS will allow us to operate heavy surveillance aircraft in addition to heavy fighters.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Navy envisages the IAC-II to be around 65,000 tonnes and capable of carrying over 50
                        aircraft.

                    You are the Executive Director of an upcoming InfoTech Company which is making a name for itself in
                    the market.
                    <br/>
                    Mr. A, who is a star performer, is heading the marketing team. In a short period of one year, he has
                    helped in doubling the revenues as well as creating a high brand equity for the Company so much so
                    that you are thinking of promoting him. However, you have been receiving information from many
                    corners about his attitude towards the female colleagues; particularly his habit of making loose
                    comments on women. In addition, he regularly sends indecent SMS’s to all the team members including
                    his female colleagues.
                    <br/>
                    One day, late in the evening, Mrs. X, who is one of Mr. A’s team members, comes to you visibly
                    disturbed. She complains against the continued misconduct of Mr. A, who has been making undesirable
                    advances towards her and has even tried to touch her inappropriately in his cabin. She tenders her
                    resignation and leaves your office.
                    <br/>
                    a) What are the options available to you?
                    <br/>
                    b) Evaluate each of these options and choose the option you would adopt, giving reasons.

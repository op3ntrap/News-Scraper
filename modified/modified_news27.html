</strong><strong>CERT-In:

</strong>The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) is an office within the Ministry 

of Electronics and Information Technology.



It is the nodal agency to deal with cyber security threats like hacking and phishing.

It strengthens security-related defence of the Indian Internet domain.



A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed in May, 2016 between Indian Computer 

Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) and Ministry of Cabinet Office, UK.



Earlier CERT-In signed MoUs with counterpart/similar organizations in about 

seven countries - Korea, Canada, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, Japan and Uzbekistan.



Ministry of External Affairs has also signed MoU with Cyber Security as one of the 

areas of cooperation with <strong>Shanghai Cooperation Organization</strong><span>.



</span>With the MoUs, participating countries can exchange technical information on Cyber attacks,

response to cyber security incidents and find solutions to counter the cyber attacks.



They can also exchange information on prevalent cyber security policies and best practices. 



The MoUs helps to strengthen cyber space of signing countries, capacity building and improving

relationship between them.</pre>

                        Constitution envisaged separation of powers among the Executive, Judiciary and Legislature and
                        one should not encroach into the domain of the other. Independence of the judiciary and courts
                        alone would ensure rule of law.

                    <li>
                        Legislation could be invalidated on the ground that there was a breach of separation of powers
                        in enacting the law, though the Legislature might have the competence to do so.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Legislature could only amend the law but could not invalidate a judgment or a decree passed
                        by the court. The law enacted by Kerala legislature was an attempt to interfere with the
                        judicial functioning, the Bench said and struck the law as unconstitutional and void.

                        </strong>
                        For Tamil Nadu, the Mullaperiyar dam and the diverted Periyar waters act as a lifeline for
                        Theni, Madurai, Sivaganga and Ramnad districts, providing water for irrigation and drinking, and
                        also for generation of power in Lower Periyar Power Station. Tamil Nadu has insisted on
                        exercising its unfettered rights to control the dam and its waters, based on the 1886 lease
                        agreement. Kerala has pointed out the unfairness in the 1886 lease agreement and has challenged
                        its validity. However, safety concerns posed by the 119-year-old dam to the safety of the people
                        of Kerala in the event of a dam collapse, have been the focus of disputes from 2009 onwards.
                        Kerala’s proposal for decommissioning the dam and constructing a new one has been challenged by
                        Tamil Nadu.

                            The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has added its bit to the ongoing debate on Universal
                            Basic Income in India.

                            The latest Fiscal Monitor of the IMF, in its analysis, used fiscal space equivalent to the
                            cost of the public distribution system and energy subsidies in 2011-12
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It showed that this can finance an annual Universal Basic Income of Rs 2,600 per person
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It is equivalent to about 20% of that year’s median per capita consumption, with the
                            estimated cost at about 3% of the gross domestic product (GDP)

                            A large proportion of the population in India still lives below the poverty line and a
                            number of government programmes providing subsidies and support to the poor are marred by
                            inefficiencies

                        <li>
                            There are leakages in the system, and often, people who actually need government support are

                            Universal Basic Income is seen by many as an alternative to the existing system of
                            subsidies, which is often associated with systemic inefficiencies

                            The Economic Survey calculations showed that a 75% universality rate with an annual
                            Universal Basic Income of Rs 7,620 per year at 2016-17 prices will cost about 5% of the GDP
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Economists calculated that an inflation-indexed Universal Basic Income of Rs 10,000 at
                            2014-15 prices—about three-quarters of that year’s poverty line—will cost about 10% of the

                            Thinking: It is often assumed that resources can be raised by rationalizing subsidies and
                            capturing a part of the revenue foregone on account of various tax exemptions, including in
                            the personal income tax
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Reality: The revenue forgone in most cases is optical and the result of poor design. In any
                            case, a part of it is now out of the system with the implementation of the goods and
                            services tax

                        <li>
                            Further, politically, it will be extremely difficult to roll back subsidies in order to
                            create fiscal space for Universal Basic Income

                            A steady, permanent and guaranteed income without any work is likely to affect labour

                            It is also likely to increase wages, as has been witnessed after the implementation of the

                            Problem: Higher wages without a commensurate increase in productivity will affect India’s

                        <li>
                            This could also have longer-term implications in terms of higher inflation and lower growth

                            It is highly likely that political parties, in order to improve their chances in elections,

                            The Indian auto industry is actively working in this direction as it helps state public

                            The auto industry has been growing at a steady pace and India is now becoming an export hub

                            This is the first time that such an event has been seen, rather than detected, and the

                        Prize in Physics for detecting gravitational waves in 2015, generated by the collision of two

                            In August this year LIGO, together with the Virgo observatory in Italy, detected waves from
                            the cataclysmic merger of two neutron stars, designated GW170817
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Soon after, the Fermi space telescope detected a burst of gamma rays from the same region of
                            space, which is a signature of massive stars in collision

                        <li>
                            The ESO then organized the astrophysical equivalent of a manhunt, marshaling its own

                            The signal was picked up in Hawaii and over the following weeks, about 70 observatories
                            watched the event unfold when they were on the dark side of the earth

                            It confirms that when neutron stars collide into a kilonova — a body 1,000 times brighter
                            than the average Nova — it produces a gamma-ray burst and gravitational waves

                            </strong>
                            This ship is unique, as about 81% is built indigenously and is the first built by India that
                            has a superstructure made up of
                            <strong>
                                carbon fibre composite material
                            </strong>
                            . This makes it a stealth corvette and makes India one among the few nations that have this
                            technology or this class of ships.

                            The carbon composite material gives it an extra stealth edge and also lowers the top weight
                            and maintenance cost.

                            The installed propulsion and auxiliary systems provides very low radiated underwater noise
                            feature, required for anti-submarine warfare.

                            The enhanced stealth features include ‘X’ form of Hull, full beam superstructure, inclined
                            ship sides and use of Infra Red Signature Suppression (IRSS).

             Founded in 1965, WMF is headquartered in New York, and has offices and affiliates around the world, including Cambodia, France, Peru, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom. In addition to hands-on management, the affiliates identify, develop, and manage projects, negotiate local partnerships, and attract local support to complement funds provided by donors.

             Every two years WMF publishes the World Monuments Watch (formerly the World Monuments Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites). Since the first list was compiled in 1996, this program has drawn international attention to cultural heritage sites around the world threatened by neglect, vandalism, armed conflict, commercial development, natural disasters, and climate change. Through the World Monuments Watch, WMF fosters community support for the protection of endangered sites, and attracts technical and financial support for the sites.

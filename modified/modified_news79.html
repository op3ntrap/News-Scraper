                        Between financial year 2012- 13 and 2015-16, the five national parties received a total of
                        Rs.1,070.68 crore via voluntary contributions above Rs.20,000.

                    <li>
                        Of this, 89%, or Rs.77 crore, was from corporate and business houses, according to the

                        The BJP received the lion’s share of the corporate donations, lapping up Rs.81 crore from 2,987
                        corporate donors. This is nearly three times the combined corporate donations received by the
                        remaining four parties.

                        or its 1967 Protocol, it is still bound by customary international law not to forcibly return
                        any refugee to a place where they face a serious risk of persecution or threats to their life or

                        Pakistan continues to be a rogue state and its unrelenting stand to tackle terrorism has led to
                        a virtual diplomatic standoff between India and Pakistan.

                        This is contributing to a strategic imbalance in the South Asian region, which is the main

                        Russia is undergoing a strategic resurgence, sustained in good measure by the close relations
                        recently established with China. Buoyed by developments in the Ukraine and Crimea, and the
                        uncertainties surrounding U.S. commitment to NATO, the new Russia-China ‘strategic congruence’
                        is certain to impact Asia.

                        At this juncture, India-Russia relations appear less robust than at any time in the past half
                        century. India’s ‘Act East and Look West’ policies have given a new dimension to Indian
                        diplomacy in both East and West Asia. However, diminishing diplomatic influence in the West
                        Asian region vis-a-vis increasing influence of Russia and China is a cause of concern.

                    <li>
                        The ‘Act East’ policy has produced better results. Closer relations with countries in East and
                        South East Asia, especially Japan and Vietnam, are a positive development. However, in the
                        Asia-Pacific, India has to contend with an increasingly assertive China. There is little
                        evidence to show that India’s diplomatic manoeuvres individually, or with allies like Japan,
                        have succeeded in keeping the Chinese juggernaut at bay — or for that matter provide an
                        alternative to China in the Asia-Pacific.

                        Indian diplomacy, therefore, needs a renewed strategy and also display still higher levels of
                        sophistication to overcome the odds.

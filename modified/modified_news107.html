                                            is a term used to describe the net capital accumulation during an accounting
                                            period for a particular country, and the term refers to additions of capital
                                            stock, such as equipment, tools, transportation assets and electricity.
                                            Countries need capital goods to replace the current assets that are used to
                                            produce goods and services, and if a country cannot replace capital goods,
                                            production declines. Generally, the higher the capital formation of an
                                            economy, the faster an economy can grow its aggregate income.

                                    About half the price paid by the Indian end-consumer for petrol goes towards paying
                                    these taxes.

                                    The government’s excise duty collection, for instance, has more than doubled during
                                    the period 2014-17, from ₹99,184 crore to ₹2,42,691 crore. This suggests quite
                                    clearly that the government, not the consumer, has been the biggest beneficiary of
                                    lower crude oil prices since 2014.

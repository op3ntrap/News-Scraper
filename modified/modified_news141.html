                    Curtailment of an individual writer/author’s right to freedom of speech and expression should never

                    From the beginning, the JWG has been dealing with the twin problems of arrest of Indian fishermen
                    and boats by Sri Lanka and Sri Lanka’s complaint against Indian fishermen for using “bottom
                    trawling” which erodes aquatic resources in the Palk Bay area.

                    The leap for India’s ballistic nuclear submarine capabilities would come with the fourth submarine

                    It would have a stronger weapons configuration integrated into an extra compartment that would be
                    added to Arihant’s original design.

                    Last October, India commissioned its first Ballistic Nuclear Submarine,
                    <strong>
                        INS Arihant
                    </strong>

                </li>
                <li>
                    The vessel, weighing 6,000 tonnes, is powered by an 83 MW pressurised light water nuclear reactor.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The project to build a strategic nuclear submarine to carry nuclear missiles began as the Advanced
                    Technology Vessel project in the 1980s, and the vessel project was launched in 2009 by Dr. Manmohan
                    Singh.

                <li>
                    Arihant, which can carry nuclear tipped ballistic missiles, is of the ship submersible ballistic
                    nuclear class.

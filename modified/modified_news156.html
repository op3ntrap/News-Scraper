                        : Vulnerable witnesses in criminal cases, often minor survivors of rape or victims of sex abuse,
                        should testify without fear or intimidation in a conducive environment.

                    <li>
                        Concerned at the trauma these victims of crime face in conventional courtrooms, the Supreme
                        Court has ordered the setting up of at least two vulnerable witnesses deposition centres in the
                        jurisdiction of every High Court across the country within the next three months.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The order upholds the right of vulnerable witnesses to be protected while testifying in court
                        and is in consonance with international norms in these matters.

                    <li>
                        Victims often end up being ill-treated by the very system they had approached in the hope of

                    <li>
                        Delay and intimidating questions during trial in a hostile environment lead to fewer

                        face of the accused; reducing cross-examination questions to writing and handing them over to
                        the judge to be put to the victim in a language that is clear and not embarrassing; and
                        sufficient breaks for victims of child abuse or rape while testifying.

                        A Committee led by the Chief Justice of India should be in charge of the appointments of
                        Chairman, Vice-Chairman and Judicial Members of the various central tribunals, which form a

                        As of now, tribunals function under the very government department which may be a litigant
                        before them, and probably, against which they may have to pass orders.

                        It said parties should be allowed to challenge a tribunal order before the Division Bench of the
                        high court having territorial jurisdiction over the tribunal or its appellate forum.

                        <strong>
                            Present Context:
                        </strong>
                        Presently, parties are deprived of an opportunity to move high courts concerned against the
                        orders of some tribunals and have to move the Supreme Court directly.

                    <li>
                        The Commission said tribunals must have benches in different parts of the country so that people
                        of every geographical area may have easy access to justice
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ideally, the benches of the tribunals should be located at all places where the high courts
                        situate. In the event of exclusion of jurisdiction of all courts, it is essential to provide for
                        an equally effective alternative mechanism even at grass root level. This could be ensured by
                        providing State- level sittings looking to the quantum of work of a particular tribunal. Once
                        that is done, the access to justice will stand ensured.

                        <li>
                            These tribunals do not enjoy the same constitutional protection as high courts
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The appointment process and service conditions of high court judges are not under the

                            The enormous institutional investment to protect the independence of high courts is
                            dispensed with when it comes to tribunals

                        <li>
                            Many tribunals still owe allegiance to their parent ministries

                            Tribunals are also not as accessible as high courts
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For example, there are just four benches of the Green Tribunal for the whole country

                        <li>
                            In comparison, high courts were easily accessible for environmental matters

                        <li>
                            Conferring a direct right of appeal to the Supreme Court from tribunals has changed the
                            Supreme Court from being a constitutional court to a mere appellate court
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It has become a final clearing house for every appeal under every statute
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The Supreme Court should be a court of last resort deciding cases of the moment, and not a
                            final forum with an all-embracing jurisdiction over disputes ranging from a custody battle
                            to the scope of a municipal by-law
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If high courts were to exercise appellate jurisdiction over orders of tribunals, they would
                            act as filters

                            divergence among high courts

                        <strong>
                            Third:

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The high courts are the training grounds for future SC judges
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When high court judges deal with several cases under a particular area of law, they carry
                            with them the benefit of their experience and insights to the SC
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When high courts are side-stepped in favour of tribunals, Supreme Court judges hearing
                            appeals from tribunals would have to deal with the finer nuances of disputes under
                            specialised areas of law for the very first time
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This is not ideal for a court of last resort
                        </li>

                    <p>

                            Original jurisdiction of the SC

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The jurisdiction of high courts is also undermined by the SC when it directly entertains
                            various writ petitions
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When the Supreme Court exercises original jurisdiction, it deprives the citizen and the
                            state of the right to challenge potentially erroneous orders
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A classic instance is the Supreme Court’s ruling in the 2G case
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To overcome this ruling, the President had to invoke the advisory jurisdiction of the SC
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The ordinary citizen enjoys no such privilege
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This difficulty becomes even more acute when the SC takes on a legislative role by framing
                            guidelines in the larger public interest
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Neither the individual nor the state has an effective remedy to challenge these norms
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <strong>
                            The way forward
                        </strong>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            It has been asserted that when the Supreme Court decides an issue, it avoids conflicting
                            judgments of the high court
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This is untrue. The SC is in a better position to resolve a dispute when it is confronted
                            with two conflicting high court rulings on the same issue
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If high courts lose their prominence, India’s justice delivery system will be the principal
                            loser

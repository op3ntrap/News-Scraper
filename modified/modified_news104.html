                        In the Aadhaar Act, biometric information essentially refers to photograph, fingerprints and
                        iris scan, though it may also extend to “other biological attributes of an individual” specified
                        by the UIDAI.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The term “core biometric information” basically means biometric information minus photograph,
                        but it can be modified once again at the discretion of the UIDAI.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        One concern is the confidentiality of personal information an individual may not wish to be
                        public or accessible to others. The Aadhaar Act puts in place some safeguards in this respect,
                        but they are restricted to biometric and identity information.

                    <li>
                        The strongest safeguards in the Act relate to core biometric information.

                        There is a view that, in practice, the biometric database is likely to be hacked sooner or

                    <li>
                        Aadhaar Act puts in place a framework to share it with “requesting entities”. The core of this
                        framework lies in Section 8 of the Act, which deals with authentication
                    </li>

                        Aadhaar Act includes a blanket exemption from the safeguards applicable to biometric and

                        This effectively makes identity information accessible to the government without major
                        restrictions.

                    <li>
                        Aadhaar is a tool of unprecedented power for mining and collating personal information.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For example, suppose Aadhaar number becomes mandatory for buying a railway ticket. With
                        computerised railway counters, government will have all the details of your railway journeys,
                        from birth onwards. The government can do exactly what it likes with this personal information
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        By the same reasoning, if Aadhaar is made mandatory for SIM cards, the government will have
                        access to your lifetime call records, and it will also be able to link your call records with
                        your travel records.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Nothing in the Aadhaar Act prevents the government from using Aadhaar to link different
                        databases, or from extracting personal information from these databases.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Indeed, many State governments under the State Resident Data Hub (SRDH) project, which
                        “integrates all the departmental databases and links them with Aadhaar number”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some of the private agencies do have access to a fair amount of personal information from their
                        own databases.

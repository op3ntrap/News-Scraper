                        Central government has floated the idea of state governments enacting their own “State Aadhaar
                        Act”, on the lines of the central Act passed by Parliament last year.

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The central Act makes Aadhaar mandatory for any “subsidy, benefit or service” for which the
                        expenditure is borne fully or shared partially by the Consolidated Fund of India.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This means that every welfare subsidy or benefit, from fully-funded or centrally-sponsored
                        schemes (where states share part of the fiscal burden), is conditional on verification through
                        Aadhaar.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <strong>
                        Why state Aadhaar Act
                    </strong>
                    ?
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Several state governments have their own subsidies or benefit schemes, where the burden is
                        defrayed out of their Consolidated Fund
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Consequently, the central Aadhaar Act cannot provide legal basis for making Aadhaar mandatory
                        for such schemes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        However, a State Aadhaar Act, as suggested by the Cabinet Secretariat, could provide legal basis
                        for making it mandatory for state-funded welfare schemes
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        But the Centre’s suggestion could prove tricky as the enactment of a state legislation is the
                        prerogative of the state legislatures.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Also, it impinges on the state government’s autonomy to set up a mechanism for expenditure from
                        the state exchequer.

                        The move runs contrary to the ministry’s stand in 2015, when it had argued for severe measures
                        to hold leaders of political parties accountable for damage to public property caused during
                        bandhs, protests and demonstrations called by them. It had also pushed for the parties to pay
                        the market value of property destroyed by their supporters.

                        Law enforcement agencies expressed the fear that the amended law may be misused to frame
                        Opposition leaders who call for bandhs, by inciting violence and damaging property.

                        Plan to emphasise on improving the quality of evidence, which will require police officers to
                        record on video all protests, hartal or bandhs,

                    <li>
                        The soft copies of video evidence will be deposited by the officer in charge at the local police
                        station with the sub-divisional magistrate or executive magistrate who will hand it over to the
                        investigating officer.

                    <li>
                        The Bill may also include a provision to make such offences non-bailable unless “there are
                        reasonable grounds to believe that (the accused) is not guilty”.

                    <li>
                        However, the provision to include “damage to private properties” is likely to be dropped in the
                        reworked Bill, since they are covered under different insurance schemes.

                        While appointing a committee to examine the law, the apex court had observed in 2009: “In almost
                        all such cases, top leaders of such organisations who really instigate such direct actions will
                        keep themselves in the background, and only the ordinary or common members or grassroot-level

                                The increasing wastage results in land degradation by about 45%, mainly due to
                                deforestation, unsustainable agricultural practices, and excessive groundwater

                                The energy spent over wasted food results in 3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide

                                Decay also leads to harmful emission of other gases in the atmosphere; for instance,

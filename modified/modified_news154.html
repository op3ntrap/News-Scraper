                    The move is aimed at allowing the judiciary to devote more time on judicial work and free them from

                        Indian Judiciary Annual Report 2016
                    </strong>
                    , pendency of cases across district courts is a staggering 2.81 crores and as many as 5,000 judges’
                    posts are vacant.

                creation of the post of Court Managers in every district court and High Court.

            <p>
                <strong>
                    Problems associated with creation of separate posts:
                </strong>
                Recruitment on contract basis, low remuneration package, reluctance on the part of the judiciary to
                accept Court Managers to participate in the judicial process have been identified as some of the reasons
                for failure to attract suitable candidates.

                    The idea behind the programme is to make parents and children aware of the dangers of online games
                    like Blue Whale. The message of the programme should be that children should not be trapped into the

                    The United States issued its direst warning to Pakistan to roll up terrorist groups operating in the
                    country and end the establishment support for such groups, warning that if Islamabad chose not to

                    The US fears for Pakistan’s own future if the country remains in denial about its continued support

                    designated terrorists such as Hafiz Saeed, Maulana Masood Azhar, and Dawood Ibrahim.

                <li>
                    These areas of snow or ice, which are subject to temperatures below 32°F for at least part of the
                    year, compose the cryosphere.

                <li>
                    The term “cryosphere” comes from the Greek word, “krios,” which means cold.

                <li>
                    Ice and snow on land are one part of the cryosphere. This includes the largest parts of the
                    cryosphere, the continental ice sheets found in Greenland and Antarctica, as well as ice caps,
                    glaciers, and areas of snow and permafrost. When continental ice flows out from land and to the sea
                    surface, we get shelf ice.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The other part of the cryosphere is ice that is found in water. This includes frozen parts of the
                    ocean, such as waters surrounding Antarctica and the Arctic. It also includes frozen rivers and
                    lakes, which mainly occur in polar areas.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The components of the cryosphere play an important role in the Earth’s climate. Snow and ice reflect
                    heat from the sun, helping to regulate our planet’s temperature. Because polar regions are some of
                    the most sensitive to climate shifts, the cryosphere may be one of the first places where scientists
                    are able to identify global changes in climate.

                    Supreme Court rejected a petition filed by a person claiming to be the daughter of the late Sanjay

                    Film is nothing but artistic expression within the parameters of law and that there is no warrant or

                    CBFC and its censorship role
                </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Recent experience suggests that the CBFC (Central Board of Film Certification) does not always see
                    itself as a certifying authority, but rather plays the censor quite merrily. In the case of Udta
                    Punjab last year, it was seeking to be the guardian of Punjab’s honour against the depiction of the
                    high prevalence of drug addiction in the State.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Bombay High Court had to remind the CBFC that certification, and not censorship is its primary
                    role and that its power to order changes and cuts must be exercised in accordance with
                    constitutional principles.
                </li>
                <li>
                    More recently, the CBFC sought to play the moral censor with regard to Lipstick Under My Burkha, a
                    film it thought was too “lady-oriented” to be given a certificate, presumably because it depicts
                    their fantasies.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Film Certification Appellate Tribunal had to intervene to secure the release of the film, with
                    an ‘A’ certificate.
                </li>
                <li>
                    These instances demonstrate that challenges to freedom come from both within the systemic framework
                    and outside.
                </li>

                    Role of court in protecting freedom of expression
                </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Courts prefer to protect the right to free expression rather than entertain excuses such as
                    maintenance of law and order and public tranquility, or someone’s sense of hurt or the fear of
                    someone being portrayed in a bad light.

                    On July 24, a Bench led by Chief Justice of India J.S. Khehar had directed doctors from P.G.I.,
                    Chandigarh, to medically examine the 10-year-old rape victim and file a report in court on whether
                    the “health of the girl child concerned, who is stated to be of the age of 10 years, and also that
                    of the foetus, would be adversely affected, if the pregnancy is continued for the full term”.

                    Supreme Court: denied the permission to grant abortion of the foetus.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Supreme Court urged the government to consider setting up permanent medical boards across the States
                    so that women, especially child rape victims, could receive expedient access to medical care.
                </li>

                    <strong>
                        Why such boards? To expedite the process.

                <li>
                    Presently, women are forced to undertake the cumbersome process of approaching different courts,
                    from district courts to high courts and finally the Supreme Court, for permission to medically
                    terminate their pregnancies which are over 20 weeks.

                <li>
                    The frequent number of such cases which have come to the Supreme Court range from child rape victims
                    to destitute women to women with substantial foetus abnormalities.

                    What is MTP Act, 1971?

                    <li>
                        Abortion in India is legal only up to twenty weeks of pregnancy under specific conditions and
                        situations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        One, the continuance of the pregnancy would involve a risk to the life of the pregnant woman or
                        of grave injury of physical or mental health, or
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Two, there is a substantial risk that if the child were born, it would suffer from such physical
                        or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped.

                        What the draft MTP bill 2014 provides?
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The draft MTP increased the legal limit for abortion from 20 weeks to 24 weeks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It provides for abortion beyond 24 weeks under defined conditions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Bill amends Section 3 of the 1971 Act to provide that “the length of pregnancy shall not
                        apply” in a decision to abort a foetus diagnosed with “substantial foetal abnormalities” or if
                        it is “alleged by the pregnant woman to have been caused by rape”.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Under the 1971 Act, even pregnant rape victims cannot abort after 20 weeks, compelling them to
                        move court.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It allows a woman to take an independent decision in consultation with a registered health-care
                        provider.

                    <li>
                        It also takes into account the reality of a massive shortage of both doctors and trained
                        midwives, and seeks to allow Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha practitioners to carry out abortions.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Why is it essential to change the MTP law?

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Foetal abnormalities show up only by 18 weeks, so just a two-week window after that is too small
                        for the would-be parents to take the difficult call on whether to keep their baby.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Even for the medical practitioner, this window is too small to exhaust all possible options
                        before advising the patient.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There is an urgent need to empower women with sexual rights, legal protection against sex crimes
                        and sex choices both in their own interest and for the sake of reducing the fertility rate as a
                        whole.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The lack of legal approval moves abortion to underground and they are done in unhygienic
                        conditions by untrained, thus, putting thousands of women at risk.

        <ul>
            <li>
                Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant opinion: India’s financial sector regulators should stop hindering ideas in
                the financial technology sector and instead opt for a
                <strong>
                    regulatory sandbox
                </strong>
                approach to nurture innovative financial technology applications.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>
                What is a regulatory sandbox?
            </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A regulatory sandbox is an experimental oversight mechanism for innovative products and services that do
                not fall into an existing regulatory regime or cut across traditional regulators’ domains.
            </li>
            <li>
                For example when you make payment transfers or remittances, assess your personal finance or insurance
                needs, compare financial products that you are considering buying or to track the performance of your
                investments.
            </li>
            <li>
                Such innovations are permitted to operate for a limited period of time at a limited scale to understand
                its efficacy and implications, so that the best alternatives for regulation can be evolved based on
                concerns that emerge.
            </li>
            <li>
                The (sandbox) option can be a great way to unlock innovations for mass public adoption, because a
                regulatory sandbox balances the twin objectives of nurturing financial innovation and safeguarding
                consumer interests.
            </li>

                Practice elsewhere

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Globally, regulatory sandboxes have been introduced in the U.K., Singapore, Australia, Malaysia and UAE.
                Each country has a certain “target group” for which sandboxing is done.
            </li>
            <li>
                All these countries have so far created a sandboxed environment to support financial institutions (FIs)
                and fintech firms
            </li>

            <strong>
                Allowing the start-ups
            </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                There are over 600 start-ups in the country in the financial technology (fintech) space
            </li>
            <li>
                Letting them operate in a ‘live, but controlled environment with some regulations relaxed, will provide
                a solid evidence base’ on their strengths and weaknesses.
            </li>
            <li>
                More than 30 of those start-ups are focused on the peer-to-peer lending space alone and their market
                potential is expected to reach $5 billion by 2020.
            </li>
            <li>
                Several start-ups are working in areas such as virtual currencies like Bitcoins, Blockchain-based
                settlements and so on.
            </li>
            <li>
                The total fintech market in India is estimated to be worth $8 billion and is expected to grow to about
                $14 billion by 2020. India is ranked amongst the top ten FinTech markets globally

                Over 70 % of the under vehicle scanners (UVS) installed at Indian Air Force (IAF) bases were

                during combat as well as peace time operations. IL-78 aircraft are dedicated for this purpose. However,
                due to inadequate infrastructure and support facilities the air to air refuelling capability was

                Audit found that the system delivered by Bharat Electricals Limited (BEL) was deficient in quality.
            </li>
            <li>
                Out of 80 missiles received up to November 2014, 20 were test fired during April-November 2014. Six of
                these missiles i.e., 30 % failed the test.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preliminary failure analysis report revealed that the missiles fell short of the target, had lower than
                the required velocity, and also there was malfunctioning of critical units like Servo Control Unit and
                Connector.

            <li>
                Two missiles had failed to take off because the booster nozzle had failed. These deficiencies posed an
                operational risk during hostilities.

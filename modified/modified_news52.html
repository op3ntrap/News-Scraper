                        Maharashtra’s new law prohibiting the social boycott of individuals, families or any community
                        by informal village councils is a step in the right direction, given the pervasive nature of the
                        problem.

                        The progressive legislation, which received Presidential assent recently and was gazetted
                        earlier this month, targets the pernicious practice of informal caste panchayats or dominant
                        sections using ostracism as a means of enforcing social conformity.

                    <li>
                        The act may serve as a template for similar legislation in other States.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Act lists over a dozen types of actions that may amount to ‘social boycott’, which has been
                        made a criminal offence punishable with imprisonment up to three years or a fine of Rs. 1 lakh
                        or both.

                        The practices it prohibits range from preventing the performance of a social or religious
                        custom, denial of the right to perform funerals or marriages, cutting off someone’s social or
                        commercial ties to preventing access to educational or medical institutions or community halls
                        and public facilities, or any form of social ostracism on any ground.

                    <li>
                        The law recognizes the human rights dimension to issues of social boycott, as well as the varied
                        forms in which it occurs in a caste-based society.

                        Its progressive sweep takes into account discrimination on the basis of morality, social
                        acceptance, political inclination, sexuality, which it prohibits. It even makes it an offence to
                        create cultural obstacles by forcing people to wear a particular type of clothing or use a
                        particular language.

                    <li>
                        This is not the first law of its type. Bombay enacted a law against excommunication in 1949, but
                        it was struck down by the Supreme Court in 1962 after the Dawoodi Bohra community successfully
                        argued that it violated the community’s constitutional right to manage its own religious
                        affairs.

                    <li>
                        One hopes the latest Act will not be vulnerable to legal challenge. Article 17 of the
                        Constitution and the Protection of Civil Rights Act outlaw untouchability in all its forms, but
                        these are legal protections intended for the Scheduled Castes.

                        In reality, members of various castes and communities also require such protection from
                        <strong>
                            informal village councils and gatherings of elders who draw on their own notions of
                            conformity, community discipline, morality and social mores
                        </strong>
                        to issue diktats to the village or the community to cut off ties with supposedly offending
                        persons and families.

                        The case of a mountaineer from Raigad is somewhat notorious. He had conquered Mt. Everest but
                        could not escape a social boycott in his village because his wife wore jeans and did not wear a
                        mangalsutra.

                        It is not a proud moment for a country when special legislation is required to prohibit social
                        discrimination, ostracism and practices repugnant to human dignity. Yet, given the prevailing
                        circumstances, any legislative assault on abhorrent social practices ought to be welcomed.

                        Bidding farewell to Parliament at a function to mark the end of his tenure, President Pranab
                        Mukherjee said here on Sunday that the institution was for “debate, discussion and dissent.”
                        Disruptions, he said, hurt the Opposition as it took away from it the opportunity to raise
                        people’s concerns.

                        the Enemy Property Act, 1968 in the last three years, had promulgated five ordinances. The Bill
                        was passed by Parliament in March. Senior Union Ministers were reportedly deputed to convince
                        the President to sign the fourth and fifth Enemy Property ordinances as he was against their
                        promulgation.

                            Ordinances when either of the two Houses of Parliament is not in session and hence it is not
                            possible to enact laws in the Parliament.

                            Conversely, it has the same limitations as the Parliament to legislate, given the

                            Just as the President of India is constitutionally mandated to issue Ordinances under
                            Article 123, the Governor of a state can issue Ordinances under Article 213, when the state
                            legislative assembly (or either of the two Houses in states with bicameral legislatures) is
                            not in session.  The powers of the President and the Governor are broadly comparable with
                            respect to Ordinance making.  However, the Governor cannot issue an Ordinance without
                            instructions from the President in three cases where the assent of the President would have
                            been required to pass a similar Bill.

                            (and Governor).  Constitutionally, important issues that have been raised include judicial
                            review of the Ordinance making powers of the executive; the necessity for ‘immediate action’
                            while promulgating an Ordinance; and the granting of Ordinance making powers to the
                            executive, given the principle of separation of powers.

                                    State of Andhra Pradesh (1985), while deliberating on the promulgation of the Andhra
                                    Pradesh Abolition of Posts of Part-time Village Officers Ordinance, 1984 which
                                    abolished certain village level posts, the Court reiterated that the Ordinance
                                    making power of the President and the Governor was a legislative power, comparable
                                    to the legislative power of the Parliament and state legislatures respectively. This
                                    implies that the motives behind the exercise of this power cannot be questioned,
                                    just as is the case with legislation by the Parliament and state legislatures.

                                    State of Bihar (1987) the legislative power of the executive to promulgate
                                    Ordinances is to be used in exceptional circumstances and not as a substitute for
                                    the law making power of the legislature.  Here, the court was examining a case where
                                    a state government (under the authority of the Governor) continued to re-promulgate
                                    ordinances, that is, it repeatedly issued new Ordinances to replace the old ones,
                                    instead of laying them before the state legislature.  A total of 259 Ordinances were
                                    re-promulgated, some of them for as long as 14 years.  The Supreme Court argued that
                                    if Ordinance making was made a usual practice, creating an ‘Ordinance raj’ the
                                    courts could strike down re-promulgated Ordinances.

                        has also proposed several measures for the larger AHINDA (Kannada acronym for minorities,

                        The eight-page declaration has 40 recommendations under six broad categories — safeguarding the

                        Significantly, the Bengaluru Declaration called for upholding Rule of Law through police reforms
                        and state action to prevent lynchings. It called for a law against gender and caste
                        discrimination at education institutions.

                        establish SC/ST land bank, where government buys these lands at market prices and re-allots to
                        the same community, to ensure non-dilution of ownership. It further recommends allocation of 20%
                        of the land in private housing layouts for urban poor.

                        The declaration calls for a wider social security net. It recommended a “living wage” and

                        were not fitted with ‘X’ weapon and sensor systems. Thus, ASW corvettes could not perform to its

                            She served the Indian Navy and the nation for over 36 years and could have become only the
                            second submarine museum of the country. But since her decommissioning in 2010, the
                            Russia-designed submarine INS Vagli has taken a tedious and uncertain course. She currently
                            lies idle at the Chennai port.

                            the Tamil Nadu government in the tourist town of Mamallapuram, was expected to be displayed
                            on a 30-acre stretch of land near the Shore Temple of the UNESCO-declared World Heritage

                            Mamallapuram has forced the vessel to lie idle at the Chennai port.

                            A 2016 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India questioned the process
                            adopted by the government to move the submarine to Mamallapuram in one piece and observed
                            that an “infructuous expenditure of Rs. 4.41 crore” was incurred due to a lack of proper
                            planning.

                            of power doctrine. While noting the rationales justifying the power to promulgate, analyse
                            whether the decision of the Supreme Court on the issue have further facilitated to resorting
                            to this power. Should the power to promulgate the ordinances be repealed?

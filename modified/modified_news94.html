                            The draft MTP increased the legal limit for abortion from 20 weeks to 24 weeks.

                        <li>
                            The Bill amends Section 3 of the 1971 Act to provide that “the length of pregnancy shall not
                            apply” in a decision to abort a foetus diagnosed with “substantial foetal abnormalities” or
                            if it is “alleged by the pregnant woman to have been caused by rape”.

                            Under the 1971 Act, even pregnant rape victims cannot abort after 20 weeks, compelling them

                            It also takes into account the reality of a massive shortage of both doctors and trained

                            Foetal abnormalities show up only by 18 weeks, so just a two-week window after that is too
                            small for the would-be parents to take the difficult call on whether to keep their baby.

                            Even for the medical practitioner, this window is too small to exhaust all possible options
                            before advising the patient.

                        <li>
                            There is an urgent need to empower women with sexual rights, legal protection against sex
                            crimes and sex choices both in their own interest and for the sake of reducing the fertility

                            The lack of legal approval moves abortion to underground and they are done in unhygienic

                    Chinese accepted to cease the construction of road, which in fact was the trigger behind the scenes.

                    Chinese escalations along the Sikkim sector that is an advantageous military zone for India could
                    have been costlier.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The forthcoming Brics summit, which they will be hosting in Xiamen, must have also played a role in
                    Chinese concern.
                </li>
                <li>
                    India should not believe the Chinese tactical move and get into a conclusion that former would stop
                    its incursions into disputed and other’s territories.
                </li>
                <li>
                    India brilliantly utilized the denial tactics to prevent China from adjusting the facts on the
                    ground.
                </li>
                <li>
                    China’s rise is a challenge to India’s supremacy in South Asia.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Looks like despite being aware of its disadvantages in Chumbi Valley, Chinese played the card to
                    trigger a rift between New Delhi and Thimphu.

                <li>
                    But Thimphu upheld its calm endorsed India’s position by calling for a return to the status quo
                    ante.

                <li>
                    But on the other the relationship of India with its other neighbours is unlike with that of Bhutan.
                    For example, In Pakistan, China has assisted the establishment of a nuclear-armed state which
                    deploys terrorists against Indiato achieve its territorially revisionist goals.

                <li>
                    Chinese presence in the Indian ocean region is also a threat to Indian supremacy.

                    long-pending controversial issue of net neutrality in a month’s time.
                </li>

                        What is net neutrality?
                    </strong>
                    Net Neutrality is the principle that service providers should treat all data on the Internet
                    equally, and not discriminate or charge differently by user, content, site, platform, or
                    application.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Demanding that the same rule should apply for the same services, telecom operators have reasoned
                    that operators are required to ensure service quality and pay levies to the government, while no
                    such rules are applicable on Internet-based calling applications such as Whatsapp and Skype.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After a series of consultation papers on related topics such as over-the-top service providers and
                    differential pricing of data services, TRAI had released a consultation paper on ‘Net neutrality’.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The regulator had last year barred telecom service providers from charging differential rates for
                    data services, effectively prohibiting Facebook’s Free Basics and Airtel Zero platform.

                    But the real fact is that removing Article 35A could lead to a squeeze in opportunities for the
                    Dogra youth.

                    recruitment in the security forces and denied scholarships and other financial assistance.

                <li>
                    The influx of “non-subjects”, in the absence of the repeal of Article 35A, will put immense pressure
                    on landholdings.

                            The base effect refers to the impact of the rise in price level (i.e. last year’s inflation)
                            in the previous year over the corresponding rise in price levels in the current year (i.e.,
                            current inflation): if the price index had risen at a high rate in the corresponding period
                            of the previous year leading to a high inflation rate, some of the potential rise is already
                            factored in, therefore a similar absolute increase in the Price index in the current year
                            will lead to a relatively lower inflation rates. On the other hand, if the inflation rate
                            was too low in the corresponding period of the previous year, even a relatively smaller rise
                            in the Price Index will arithmetically give a high rate of current inflation.

                            Low closing stock levels of sugar in the domestic market are likely to support the sugar
                            prices in the near term.

                            UP-based mills are likely to be benefit from healthy sugar prices along with continued
                            healthy volumes and recovery rates, although that impact could be partly offset by higher

            <strong>
                Question 1.
            </strong>
            You are working as Junior Engineer in a Tehsil. You have been given responsibility to measure MGNREGA works
            undertaken by 3 Gram Panchayats.
        </p>
        <p>
            You have authority to give technical sanctions to all MGNREGA works. In one of these Panchayats you notice
            that your predecessor had wrongly measured many works, and in many cases he had approved works that never
            existed. One day few elected members of that Panchayat with bundle of job cards come to you to seek
            ‘sanction’ for the works done by them. When enquired, they reveal that they were contractors who had
            completed works under MGNREGA. When you reject their demand, they threaten you and tell you that the
            previous Junior Engineer was made to quit his job because he didn’t listen to them. This is your first job
            and is very important to sustain your family. There have been precedents in the past that some junior
            officials were beaten to death in some parts of the Tehsil.
        </p>
        <p>
            What will you do in this situation? Explain in detail citing rules from MGNREGA Act.

        <ul>
            <li>
                I would tell contractor that there is provision of social audit for MGNREGA and in future it is most
                likely that they would get caught in future. Also the provision of DBT and biometric authentication will
                reveal all their wrong doings.
            </li>
            <li>
                Subsequently i will report such incidence to my higher authorities and seek police protection in case my
                life is at risk. A report of bogus as well as valid JOB card shall be separately prepared by me which
                shall lie as a proof for all past irregularities.
            </li>
            <li>
                My courage and uprightness will deter me from succumbing to their demands. In any case if i comply as
                directed by contractors, my job would be in peril. Truth can’t be hidden for long and its better to be
                courageous than to hide facts and face future actions.

                                To get the same increase in production, farmers have to apply more and more fertilisers
                                and pesticides over time which raises costs of cultivation, without a proportionate

                                First- We need transition to a more ecologically resilient agriculture (becomes more
                                urgent in the context of climate change)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Second- We must radically reform the management of both surface and groundwater
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Third- We require continued diversification to other forms of livelihood, such as
                                livestock and fisheries, which are among the fastest-growing segments of the rural
                                economy
                            </li>

                                We must also shift focus away from water-intensive rice and wheat

                            <li>
                                This means radical changes in the way we grow these crops (seed, water and input
                                regimes) but also much greater encouragement to millets and pulses, which are
                                nutritionally far superior alternatives in a country beset with the diabetes epidemic
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The best way would be to include millets and pulses in the massive anganwadi and mid-day
                                meal programmes
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Fourth- Investments in agro-processing infrastructure are urgently required that would
                                enable farmers to move up the value chain
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Fifth- we need to ensure access to credit and crop insurance, especially to our 85%
                                small and marginal farmers
                            </li>

                                Sixth- We need strong Farmer Producer Organisations, to overcome massive handicaps faced
                                by isolated farmers and enable them to really benefit from market participation

                                More production at less costs: As farmers reduce their dependence on synthetic
                                fertilisers and pesticides, they slowly emerge from the ecological vicious cycle and are
                                also able to dramatically reduce their costs of cultivation, without compromising on

                        Navigation Indian Constellation (NavIC) is an independent Indian satellite-based positioning

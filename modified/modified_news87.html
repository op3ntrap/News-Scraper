                        Tropical storm Pakhar has brought high intensity winds and very heavy rain to Hong Kong and
                        Macau; merely four days after one of the strongest typhoons on record, Hato, caused severe

                                different names for these storms in different locations.

                                In the Atlantic and Northeast Pacific, it is called as “hurricane”. A similar
                                disturbance in the Northwest Pacific is known as a “typhoon” and in the South Pacific
                                and Indian Ocean it is referred to as “cyclones”.

                </p>

                    <li>
                        Article 35A in the Indian Constitution is a provision which gives the J&amp;K Legislature a
                        carte blanche to decide who all are ‘
                        <strong>
                            permanent residents
                        </strong>
                        ’ of the State and confer on them special rights and privileges in public sector employment,
                        purchase of property in the State, scholarships and other government aid and welfare. It
                        mandates that no act of the legislature coming under it can be challenged for violation of the
                        Constitution or any other law of the land.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Article 35A was added into the Constitution in 1954 by an order of the then President Rajendra
                        Prasad on the advice of the Union Cabinet led by Jawaharlal Nehru. The controversial
                        Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order of 1954 followed the 1952 Delhi Agreement,
                        which provided Indian citizenship to the citizens of J&amp;K.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Presidential Order was issued under
                        <strong>
                            Article 370 (1) (d)
                        </strong>
                        of the Constitution. This feature allows the President to make certain “exceptions and
                        modifications” to the Constitution for the benefit of citizens of J&amp;K.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        So Article 35A was included in the Constitution as a mark of the special consideration the
                        Indian government extended to the ‘permanent residents’ of J&amp;K.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The President incorporated Article 35A into the Constitution by bypassing the parliamentary
                        route.
                        <strong>
                            Article 368 (i)
                        </strong>
                        of the Constitution mandates that only the Parliament can amend the Constitution. So the
                        question is did the President act outside his jurisdiction? Is Article 35A null and void because
                        the government did not carry out a Parliamentary discussion?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A five-judge Bench of the Supreme Court in its 1961 judgment discussed the powers of the
                        President under Article 370 to ‘amend’ the Constitution, during the Puranlal Lakhanpal vs. The
                        President of India case. The court observed that the President can modify an existing article in
                        the Constitution under Article 370 but the SC ruling is silent over the President’s power to
                        introduce a new Article without the Parliament’s knowledge. This question remains unanswered.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Critics argue that Article 35A goes against the principles of equality and as well as the unity
                        and integrity of India. They argue that it restricts citizens from other States from getting
                        jobs or acquiring property in J&amp;K and is a violation of fundamental rights enshrined under
                        Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Article 35A has also been challenged for protecting certain provisions of the J&amp;K
                        Constitution, which limits the basic right to property if a native woman marries a man who does
                        not possess a certificate of permanent residence.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Recently, a Supreme Court Bench has indicated that the validity of Articles 35A and 370 may
                        ultimately be decided by a Constitution Bench.

                    <li>
                        The Vice-Chairman of NITI Aayog reports directly to the Prime Minister and wields a powerful

                        Reviving the formal economy, spurring private investment and creating jobs is likely to be the
                        focus of Mr. Kumar and he feels all other economic priorities must make way for employment
                        creation.

                    <li>
                        Mr. Kumar believes higher employment will automatically push the Indian economy close to double
                        digit growth. He holds strong views about India’s foreign trade policy and could prioritise the
                        overhaul of the export incentives system.

                    <li>
                        He could bring some relief for citizens as he believes the government could lower the high taxes
                        on petroleum products to encourage consumption and investment demand.

                        ensure unemployment doesn’t lead them astray. This programme would have to be run by the armed
                        forces and national integration has to be its principal objective.

                        The number of people displaced by conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo, mainly in the
                        volatile Kasai region, has nearly doubled in the last six months to 3.8 million
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        UNHCR has said that food and clothing was required for the 1.4 million refugees in Kasai who
                        have fled their homes due to violence that has killed more than 3,000 people.

                        In the south eastern province of Tanganyika, clashes between Bantus and Pygmies have also forced
                        thousands to seek refuge, as has the long-running conflict in the Kivu region
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In Kasai, clashes began last September after the killing of a tribal chieftain, known as the
                        Kamwina Nsapu, who rebelled against the authority of President Joseph Kabila’s regime in
                        Kinshasa and its local authorities.

                    <li>
                        The murder sparked large scale violence that has escalated and has led to alleged human rights
                        violations such as extrajudicial killings, rapes, torture and the use of child soldiers, all of
                        which constitute violation of international law.

                    <li>
                        At the same time, the country is also coping with the arrival of about 500,000 refugees fleeing
                        conflict in neighbouring Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan and the Central African Republic where
                        about 60,000 people have fled to DRC this year.

          Space entrepreneurs plan to improve the livelihood of farmers without directly working with them by deploying a combination of satellite imagery, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things (IoT), and big data analytics.

                        <li>
                            This technology can help farmers to acquire bank loans, timely and correct insurance claims
                            and may be even ensure a good MSP (minimum support price) for their crop.

                            This can be done by syncing satellite imagery-based information with ground level data and
                            this in turn can be used to improve the livelihood of farmers

                            By reducing the risks associated with India’s weather dependent, subsistence farming; this
                            idea should make it easier for the farmer to increase his income; and get agricultural loans
                            and insurance and its timely settlement. In return the government can spend less on
                            insurance premium subsidies and agriculture insurance companies will have less pay-out to
                            make and it can also serve as a scientific basis for fixing MSPs.

                            cropping seasons — the summer Kharif and the winter Rabi — they could predict crop yields
                            that were 85-90% accurate and this has been now fine-tuned to 95%. Conventional or manual

                            the Union and State governments had declared towards crop insurance premium.

                        <li>
                            The team focussed on embedding hollow microspheres into high density polyethylene, which is
                            the most commonly moulded plastic product.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Through a method of trial and error spanning two years, researchers have managed to shed
                            plastic usage by nearly 20%. They have replaced it with glass microballoons and fly ash
                            cenospheres.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The challenge with composite materials is that it is developed in controlled conditions in
                            the lab which cannot be replicated in the industry. But with the new technique that has been
                            developed, low-cost, light-weight composites can be manufactured at any industry using the
                            regular compression moulding machines
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            While hollow microspheres and composites are lighter and cheaper, the challenge facing the
                            team was to ensure the microspheres remained intact despite the processes of industrial
                            moulding.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            By successfully imbibing hollow spheres into otherwise solid plastic base, the density of
                            the material has been brought down by nearly 50%. The end material was found to have a
                            significantly greater ability to absorb energy.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The researchers believe that this could help in the production of more light-weight material
                            and the reduced usage of plastics. For instance, the reduction in weight will significantly
                            improve fuel efficiency in cars and planes.

                            Scientists from CSIR have been able to produce ethanol from discarded cotton-stalks by a
                            combination of chemical and biological techniques. India has about 9.4 million hectares
                            under cotton cultivation and each hectare generates around 2 million tonnes of cotton stalk
                            wastes.

                        <li>
                            The cotton stalks were first treated with an acid, alkali and different enzymes to help
                            breakdown the complex organic polymers. Agro-residues are generally tough in nature and it
                            requires chemical pre-treatment to help break down the complex structure of the stalk.

                        <li>
                            The acid aids in removal of hemicellulose which a polymer of the cell wall and the alkali
                            extracts lignin which is a binding matrix in the cell wall made up of complex phenolic.
                            These treatments expose cellulose to the action of enzymes. By using enzymes, the cellulose
                            was further treated to convert it into glucose.

                            To convert the glucose into ethanol, fermentation using a novel yeast strain was carried
                            out. Researchers isolated the yeast-Saccharomycescerevisiae-RRP-03N, from a rotting wild

                            The yeast displayed a glucose conversion efficiency of 76% and the entire glucose was
                            consumed by the yeast in just 24 hours and was converted into alcohol. This performance is
                            superior to any other organism reported for fermentation of cotton stalk.

                            Bioethanol has many advantages over conventional fuels as it comes from a renewable source.
                            It is now mandatory to blend 10% ethanol with petrol.

                            Bioethanol that is presently in use is obtained via fermentation of molasses which is a
                            by-product of sugar production and it has food value.

                            Most of this first generation ethanol finds its way into consumer applications, primarily as
                            liquor/alcohol. By converting such agro-residues to ethanol we can reduce the food vs fuel
                            competition.

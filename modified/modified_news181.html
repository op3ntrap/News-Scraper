                    Realising the importance of the logistics sector to promote trade, the government has created a
                    separate special secretary-level post in the Commerce Ministry to coordinate with all the ministries
                    concerned and departments.

                    Earlier, there was no single department or ministry to look at all aspects related to logistics
                    covering various modes of shipment such as sea, roads and railways.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Exporters, too, have time and again demanded a specific department to deal with the issues related
                    to logistics.

                            Huge investments are required in the sector to boost the country’s trade, and granting
                            infrastructure status would help the industry attract investments.

                            Definition of logistics includes industrial parks, warehouses, cold storages and
                            transportation.

                        <li>
                            This status would help the sector get credit at competitive rates and on a long-term basis
                            as rising logistics cost impacts the global competitiveness of exporters

                        <li>
                            Logistics costs of exports are very high in India and due to this, Indian goods are less
                            competitive in global markets.

                        <li>
                            According to a report, about 14 per cent of the total value of goods goes into the logistics
                            cost. On the other hand, in other major economies, this is just 6-8 per cent.

                            A strategy paper released in 2010 by the Commerce Ministry had emphasised on the need to
                            invest billions of dollars in improving infrastructure, including logistics, to boost
                            exports.

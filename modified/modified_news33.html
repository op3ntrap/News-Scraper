                            Within the Antarctica’s continent one can find isolated ice-free nooks — nunataks (exposed
                            mountain tops), scree slopes, cliffs, valleys and coastal oases — which cover less than 1%
                            of the area.

                            A paper published in Nature indicates the possibility of expansion of these ice-free islands
                            over 17,000 sq.km (a 25% increase) due to climate change

                            Much of the life thrives in Antarctica’s ice-free pockets: small invertebrates (nematodes,
                            springtails, and tardigrades) vascular plants, lichen, fungi, mosses and algae. They also
                            serve as breeding ground for sea birds (including the Adelie penguins) and elephant seals.

                            loving species of mangroves are replaced by salt-water loving ones. Immediate impact of
                            salinity will be on the fishing community, where commercially sought after fish species will
                            be replaced by fish that does not have as much market value.

<strong>Carbon sequestration</strong><span> is the process

 involved in carbon capture and the long-term

 storage of atmospheric 

carbon dioxide.</span>Carbon sequestration involves 

long-term storage of carbon dioxide or other forms of 

carbon to mitigate or defer global warming. It has been 

proposed as a way to slow the atmospheric and marine 

accumulation of greenhouse gases, which are released by 

burning fossil fuels.



Carbon dioxide (CO2) is naturally captured from the atmosphere through biological,

chemical, and physical processes. Artificial processes have been devised to produce 

similar effects, including large-scale, artificial capture and sequestration of 

industrially produced CO2 using subsurface saline aquifers, reservoirs, ocean water, 

aging oil fields, or other carbon sinks.</pre>

              title="Xi draws ‘red line’ in Hong Kong"/><strong>Hong Kong: </strong>

Hong Kong, officially the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region

of the People's Republic of China, is an autonomous territory on the 

Pearl River  Delta of China.



Hong Kong ranks as the world's fourth most densely populated 

sovereign state or territory.



Hong Kong and China:

After the First Opium War (1839–42), Hong Kong became a British colony.



Hong Kong was later occupied by Japan during World War II until British control resumed in 1945.



In the early 1980s, negotiations between the United Kingdom and China resulted in the 1984 

Sino-British Joint Declaration, which paved way for the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong 

in 1997, when it became a special administrative  region (SAR) of the Peoples Republic of China with 

a high degree of autonomy.



Under the principle of "one country, two systems",Hong Kong maintains a separate political and

economic system from China. Except in military defence and foreign affairs, Hong Kong maintains its 

independent executive, legislative and judiciary powers. 



In addition, Hong Kong develops relations directly with foreign states and international organisations 

in a broad range of "appropriate fields". </pre>

                                    Truenat MTB is 50% cheaper than GeneXpert
                                </li>

                                    Truenat MTB is chip-based and will be more environment-friendly compared  to
                                    GeneXpert which is cartilage-based
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Truenat MTB can be expanded to primary health centre level, which cannot be done
                                    using GeneXpert which needs uninterrupted power supply and air conditioning
                                </li>

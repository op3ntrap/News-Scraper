                <li>
                    Supreme Court directed that vehicles without valid pollution under control (PUC) certificates would
                    not be eligible for the annual insurance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        The Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) recommended for
                    </strong>
                    mandatory linking of PUC certificates with annual insurance. This recommendation was made by the
                    EPCA in its report on assessment of the Pollution Under Control programme in Delhi and the National
                    Capital Region.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Supreme Court has now accepted this particular recommendation made by EPCA.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The court also directed the linking of PUC centres with an online network and data centres to
                    prevent manual tampering. It asked the State governments to audit PUC centres and set up a strong
                    oversight system to ensure credible tests and emission results.

                    <strong>
                        Advantages of linking:
                    </strong>
                    ensure compliance with respect to emission norms and a subsequent dip in vehicular emission levels.

                    </strong>
                    In Delhi, only 23% of vehicles come for PUC tests.

                    Statutory exception to rape was violative of right to life, liberty, equality and was

                <li>
                    The Exception is part of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act of 2013 and is contrary to the Protection

                    Between 2010 and 2015, PAT has declined for all sub sectors and shows volatility for the logistics

                    For manufacturers, GST has now replaced the multiple state VATs and the need to have a hub across
                    all states will cease to exist.

                <li>
                    Allow firms to redesign supply chains and centralize hub operations to take advantage of scale
                    economies. It will also allow firms to employ efficient practices such as bulk-breaking and
                    cross-docking from a central location
                </li>
                <li>
                    For transport services, the “reverse charge mechanism” can be levied as before but the taxpayer will
                    not be able to claim input tax credit, as the main input cost is fuel which is outside the purview
                    of GST
                </li>
                <li>
                    Under GST, the tax on warehouse, storage and other labour services has increased from 15% to 18%. So
                    a third-party logistics provider will now have more incentive.

                    Ease of entry across states will reduce transportation delays with measures such as the e-way bill

                <li>
                    GST will bring a lot of alignment of value-added services in the logistics sector. This will make
                    way for cutting-edge investments and mergers and can see a phenomenal increase in asset utilization
                    and increase in operational efficiency

                <li>

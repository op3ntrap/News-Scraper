                            The number one reason for a domestic company to set up a shell company is to realize a tax

                            Large corporations, like in the Apple example, have decided to move jobs and profits
                            offshore, taking advantage of looser tax codes. This is the process of “off shoring” or
                            “outsourcing” work that was once conducted domestically.

                <li>
                    However, unlike in the case of liquified petroleum gas, subsidy on fertilizers will not be passed on
                    to farmers directly as the latter cannot be forced to shell out large sums upfront for fertilizers
                    and get bank transfers later.

                    subsidy involved in every individual sale to farmers with the companies within a week of the
                    transaction.

                    will capture sales data including the identity of the farmer, quantity of purchase, soil health

                    In many parts of the world, construction in cities or in urbanising areas does not take into
                    consideration the existing topography, surface water bodies, stream flows, etc.

                    In much of India, urban growth over the past few decades has ignored the hydrology of the land

                    For decades, urbanisation has ignored ecological principles associated with water bodies,

                    Development needs to be climate-smart, but also avoid social and institutional challenges such as

                    Construction on existing lake beds and other waterbodies needs to be removed or redesigned to allow

                    As the frequency of extreme weather events increases around the world, losses in rich countries are

                    Those who are the most vulnerable and the poorest end up bearing the brunt of the burdens of climate

                    Two high-intensity solar flares were emitted, the second of which was the
                    <strong>
                        most intense recorded
                    </strong>
                    since the start of this sun cycle in December 2008, NASA said.

                    These radiation flares, which can disrupt communications satellites, GPS and power grids by reaching
                    the upper earth atmosphere, were detected and captured by the US Space Agency’s Solar Dynamics
                    Observatory.

                    The current cycle of the sun, which began in December 2008, saw the intensity of solar activity
                    decline sharply, opening the way to the “
                    <strong>
                        solar minimum”.

                            At the end of the active phase, these eruptions become increasingly rare but still can be
                            powerful.

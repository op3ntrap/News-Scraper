                        The twelfth Finance Commission had suggested that it was time now to perhaps look at a
                        Constitutional amendment to fix a ceiling on the distribution of the net tax proceeds, with the
                        Finance Commission arbitrating on distributing tax proceeds among states.

                        The Commission itself reckons that its biggest role has been to uphold the country’s federal
                        structure, and to be an architect of fiscal restructuring – from being mainly an arbitrator
                        between the Centre and states.

                        years ago. The country is only 77% of the way to gender parity in economic opportunity, a gap

                        India, which sank to No. 108 overall, down 10 places from 2006 was the reverse of the US, with
                        high rankings for women’s political empowerment but near the bottom in health, education and
                        economic participation. Economics is a particular area of concern, because women do a
                        disproportionate amount of unpaid work, like childcare.

                        health. One metric was life expectancy: Chinese women outlive men by less than two years on
                        average, compared with a global average of five years. While about 70 percent of Chinese women
                        participate in the work force, they earn only 64% of men’s wages.

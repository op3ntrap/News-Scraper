                        If the Delhi government enforces the odd-even scheme without the propsed exemptions, as the
                        National Green Tribunal (NGT) ordered, the Capital’s public transport infrastructure would need
                        a significant refurbishment.

                        According to government sources, the combined capacity of State-run buses and the Delhi Metro
                        would need to be doubled to cater to just the registered number of two-wheeler users during
                        implementation of the vehicle rationing measure.

                        Public transport needs to be streamlined. We need to have evaluated pathways only for buses.
                        Merely increasing the number of buses is not a solution.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Road transport expert Dr. S.M. Sarin, questioning the efficiency of the odd-even scheme, said,
                        “The contribution of vehicles (to air pollution levels) is only 16% to 20%.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the government goes ahead with its previous model of the scheme, there will be more
                        two-wheelers and rickshaws on the road, rendering the task futile.”

                        The tax rate for manufacturers under the composition scheme was also reduced to 1 percent from

                        The hike in the threshold for the composition scheme would require an amendment in the CGST Act,

      The country’s first technology-driven Mysuru public transport system has become “smart, safe, efficient” and beneficial to lakhs of people across the city, the World Bank has said in its latest newsletter.

                    What World Bank report said
                </strong>
                ?
            </p>
            <p>
                Mysuru has become the first Indian city to transform its bus services into a safe, efficient and smart
                system across its entire territory, benefiting both the people and the city.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Project
                </strong>
                :
            </p>
            <p>
                The World bank-aided project (Rs. 19 crore) launched in 2012 helped the Karnataka State Road Transport
                Corporation (KSRTC) to install GPS enabled mini-computers above the driver’s seat in each of the city’s
                430 buses.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, each bus and bus stop was geo-mapped and tagged, and the details fed into an IT-enabled
                intelligent system.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    How it works
                </strong>
                :
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, at the central control room in the heart of the city, a giant screen displays the speed and
                location of each bus – blinking green, yellow or orange depending on whether a bus is on time, late or
                early. Moreover, lights splash whenever a driver speeds, accelerates sharply, slams the brakes, or
                stalls for more than 20 minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The intelligent transport system has not only resulted in a more people-friendly bus service but has
                also led to smoother operations and considerable savings for the operator
            </p>
            <p>
                With drivers being more careful, incidents of rash and dangerous driving have also dropped considerably.
                Besides, women now feel safer using public transport system, even after dark, the World Bank claimed.
            </p>
            <p>
                KSRTC now saves Rs. 1 crore a year on its city bus operations. Now, the Centre has proposed these
                projects under the Smart City concept.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, the project is worth being emulated in other cities across the country.

                    Hurricane Harvey
                </strong>
                , the most powerful to hit the United States in 13 years, left a trail of destruction as it swept across
                Texas on Sunday, pummelling the region with heavy rains and claiming at least two lives since making
                landfall on the US’ Gulf Coast.
            </p>
            <p>
                Harvey continued to batter Texas as rescuers grappled with heavy rains to reach out to people stranded
                due to the hurricane.
            </p>
            <p>
                With winds topping 130 mph, Harvey is the first

                since Hurricane Carla in 1961.
            </p>
            <p>
                Harvey bombarded the stretch of the Gulf Coast in Texas with home-ripping winds and torrential rains.

                Indian-American Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal said though India-U.S. relations had improved, there were
                many challenges ahead, including issues related to immigration, the H-1B visa programme and foreign
                policy.

            </p>
            <p>
                Just reacting against H-1Bs and shutting down the programme or restricting the programme would do
                tremendous harm to the U.S. economy.
            </p>
            <p>
                As do most Americans, believed immigration was a good thing for the U.S. Unfortunately, the current
                administration had been putting out a lot of anti-immigration messages, which make it difficult to move
                a good policy forward.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was a need to have a system that caters to different needs of the economy but also makes sense to
                American workers.
            </p>
            <p>
                India is a big trading partner to the U.S. and is a big potential market. The world’s largest democracy
                and the world’s oldest democracy are good partners to have together.
            </p>
            <p>
                Commenting on the democratic processes in the U.S. and France, which faced cyberattacks and where fake
                news was propagated on social media to impact elections, Ms. Jayapal said that countries such as India
                should be concerned about cybersecurity and fake news.

                The government think-tank in its three-year action plan, released last week, has said that a focus on
                the domestic market through an import-substitution strategy would give rise to a group of relatively
                small firms behind a high wall of protection.
            </p>
            <p>
                Contrary to some assertions that India’s growth has been ’jobless’, the Employment Unemployment Surveys
                (EUS) of the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) has consistently reported low and stable rates of
                unemployment over more than three decades.
            </p>
            <p>
                Indeed, unemployment is the lesser of India’s problems. The more serious problem, instead, is severe
                underemployment.

                Citing examples of top manufacturing countries like South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and China, it said,

            </p>
            <p>
                Noting that with Chinese wages rising due to an ageing workforce and many large-scale firms in
                labour-intensive sectors currently manufacturing in that country are looking for lower-wage locations,
                the Aayog said, “with its large workforce and competitive wages, India would be a natural home for these
                firms.

            <p>
                Therefore, the time for adopting a manufactures- and exports-based strategy could not be more opportune.

                The Aayog in its ‘Three Year Action Agenda’ also recommended for the creation of a handful of Coastal
                Employment Zones (CEZ), which may attract multinational firms in labour-intensive sectors from China to
                India.
            </p>
            <p>
                The presence of these firms will give rise to an ecosystem in which local small and medium firms will
                also be induced to become highly productive thereby multiplying the number of well-paid jobs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Making a case for reforming labour laws, the Niti Aayog also noted that recently fixed-term employment
                has been introduced in the textiles and apparel industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                This option may be extended to all sectors. The change will encourage employers to rely on regular
                fixed-term employment instead of contract workers, especially when hiring workers for specific projects
                or for meeting seasonal demand.
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides, the Aayog pointed out that unifying the existing large number of labour laws into four codes
                without reform of the laws themselves will serve little purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unless we bring about substantive change either by amending the existing laws or rewriting them afresh,
                we cannot expect to change the current situation where low-productivity and low-wage jobs dominate the
                landscape.

                The Finance Ministry is open to providing capital support for facilitating consolidation among
                state—owned banks, which are reeling under mounting bad loans.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Union Cabinet has approved the setting up of an alternative mechanism, or a panel of ministers, to

        Advantages of GST:

                GST will free the common man from tax terrorism and inspector raj. Besides being a transparent and fair
                system that will end generation of black money and corruption, GST will promote a new governance culture
                that will end harassment at the hand of tax officials.
            </p>
            <p>
                By replacing the old regime of 17-odd indirect levies fragmented at state lines by a single tax; the
                Indian economy stands to benefit tremendously with a simplified, transparent tax structure that will
                help reduce discretion, lower litigation and improve ease of doing business thus helping attract foreign
                direct investment and improving industry competitiveness.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is estimated that GST may contribute an 80 basis point rise in GDP growth over 3-5 years.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    <u>

                    </u>
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                For automobiles, the shift to GST has largely been to the benefit of the industry and the consumer
                except for certain issues.
            </p>
            <p>
                The higher GST rate for hybrid vehicles will make them unviable for consumers and will result in petrol
                and diesel variants being sold instead.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is not be desirable as hybrids are much more fuel-efficient and environment-friendly vehicles.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, levy of tax on used cars at the same rate as for new cars is likely to push this business in the
                informal sector.
            </p>
            <p>
                This would negate the Centre’s aim of bringing the unregulated part of this business under the regulated
                mainstream and also lead to the state losing tax revenue in the process.
            </p>
            <p>
                As we are still in the early phase of the regime, it is hoped that these and other important issues will
                be addressed soon.

            </p>
            <p>
                Another important change in the indirect tax system is the shift in the taxable event from the sale,
                manufacture, provision of service or import in the past, to the supply of goods and/or services under
                GST.
            </p>
            <p>
                Further, as the GSTN system matches the details of tax paid by a supplier to the details of credit
                claimed by the recipient, excess credit claim by the recipient will be disallowed automatically till the
                time the return is rectified. Thus, the new system motivates recipients to keep a check on suppliers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, the GST-compliance rating system for suppliers has shifted part of the burden of ensuring
                compliance to the recipient. This, along with technology enablement, will surely improve compliance
                significantly.
            </p>
            <p>
                The GST structure has been criticised owing to multiple slabs and high effective peak rate of GST. It
                has been argued by many that the true spirit of GST has been lost and that a high GST rate will fuel
                inflation. However, the Government has done well to be pragmatic, remain in touch with ground realities
                and not get carried away by ambitious expectations. In the present socio-economic context, it is
                unrealistic to expect a single or a two-tax slab structure.

                Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Sunday wrote an article highlighting the benefits of the Pradhan Mantri
                Jan Dhan Yojana, which has completed three years, saying the combination of the scheme with Aadhaar and
                the mobile revolution would bring all Indians into the mainstream and would end economic and social
                exclusion.
            </p>
            <p>
                JAM, a term coined, and a vision conceptualized, by our Chief Economic Adviser, is nothing short of a
                social revolution because it has brought together financial inclusion (PMJDY), biometric identification
                (Aadhaar) and mobile telecommunications.
            </p>
            <p>

                The poor will have access to financial services and be cushioned against life’s major shocks. Government
                finances will be improved because of the reduced subsidy burden; at the same time, government will also
                be strengthened because it can transfer resources to citizens faster and more reliably and with less
                leakage.

                        Cloud Seeding: Cloud seeding is a form of weather modification, a way of changing the amount or
                        type of precipitation that falls from clouds, by dispersing substances into the air that serve
                        as cloud condensation or ice nuclei, which alter the microphysical processes within the cloud.
                        The most common chemicals used for cloud seeding include silver iodide, potassium iodide and dry
                        ice (solid carbon dioxide). Liquid propane, which expands into a gas, has also been used.

                Researchers have found that the common bonnet monkey of South India may soon become an ‘endangered’

            </p>

                They say the distributional range of this monkey is shrinking in eastern Maharashtra, northern parts of

                monkey from the northern region.

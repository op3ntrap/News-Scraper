                    The home ministry has asked Left Wing Extremism (LWE)-affected states to distribute 15 lakh solar
                    lamps to students in the 35 worst affected districts until all villages are electrified.
                </li>

                    Home Minister Rajnath Singh is learnt to have instructed states to expedite the process of
                    distributing the solar lamps so that students don’t suffer for want of electricity.
                </li>

                    The official said though the recruitment by Maoists has seen a declining trend, the government
                    wanted to reach out to the youth in villages.

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    President Ram Nath Kovind expressed concern over the
                    <strong>
                        “unacceptably low”
                    </strong>
                    representation of women, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes in the
                    higher judiciary. He called for long-term measures to remedy this situation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    He said that only 4,700 of the 17,000 judges — roughly one in four — in India were women.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Kovind said all the three organs of the State — the judiciary, the executive and the legislature —
                    needed to be careful not to cross into one another’s finely defined spaces. “Public life is today a
                    glasshouse. There is a relentless demand for transparency and scrutiny. Our legal fraternity needs
                    to be mindful of these legitimate urges of the people — the ultimate masters in a democracy. All
                    three organs of the State are obligated to be models of good conduct,”
                </li>
                <li>
                    The President said there was a need to look at
                    <strong>
                        alternative dispute resolution

                <li>
                    Kovind said lawyer fees needed to be brought down and India’s reputation of having an expensive
                    legal system must be changed.

                <li>
                    The Centre and the State governments should engage in greater cooperation so that differences on
                    issues such as deployment of Central forces are resolved quickly.

                <li>
                    It is important for everyone to promote the spirit of cooperation with greater zeal and expressed

                    The existing policy charges 6% as road tax for vehicles costing up to Rs 20 lakh and 8% for vehicles

                    The so-called L1 point is 1.5 million kilometres away. Here, due to the delicate balance of
                    gravitational forces, the satellite will require very little energy to maintain its orbit. Also it
                    will not be eclipsed from the sun. The 1,500-kg class satellite will be programmed to orbit this
                    point and image the sun’s magnetic field from space for the very first time in the world.

                    For the last 70 years, Mahendragiri gecko did not get its rightful place in the classification

                    DNA sequence data showed that these two geographically-separated populations are different and a

                    After seeking the Centre’s nod for shifting of tigers from Ranthambhore to Mukundara Hills Tiger
                    Reserve, the Rajasthan government has asked for permission to bring tigers from other States for
                    their rehabilitation and cross-mating in order to develop strong breeds of the big cat.

                <li>
                    The Sariska Tiger Reserve in Alwar district, where the tiger population had vanished a few years
                    ago, had brought back a significant number of big cats.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Shifting tigers to Rajasthan would help resolve the problem of hereditary diseases among them and
                    improve their breeds through cross-mating.

                    majestic cat is still missing from its wildlife population.

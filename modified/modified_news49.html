                    The plan lays emphasis on awareness programmes, entomological surveillance and outbreak warning

                        Famous 1993 study by David Card and Alan B. Krueger found that a rise in the minimum wage in New
                        Jersey actually decreased unemployment.

                        “Seattle’s Minimum Wage Experience 2015-16”, a 2017 found that since the city raised its minimum
                        wage in 2015, unemployment dropped from 4.3% to 3.3%.

                        The minimum wage increases unemployment, except when it is set below the market price for
                        labour; or only marginally higher, in which case the minimum wage enhances the bargaining power

                        Independently of the ‘twin balance sheet problem’, Keynesian economics has long recognised that
                        lowering the rate of interest may not do much for private investment if the expected rate of
                        return is depressed
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The slowing of both global trade and domestic manufacturing may have had precisely this effect
                        by lowering the long-term expectations held by private investors
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Buoying up of flagging demand can be done through public investment
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Infrastructure is unique in that spending on it raises aggregate demand and when it actually
                        comes on stream, it raises the productivity of investment elsewhere in the economy
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ‘Roads and bridges’ are a metaphor for the public infrastructure that the Indian economy can
                        fruitfully absorb today

                        The government has given the project the acronym SVAROP, which stands for Scientific Validation

                        panchgavya — the concoction of cow dung, cow urine, milk, curd and ghee — in various spheres
                        such as nutrition, health and agriculture

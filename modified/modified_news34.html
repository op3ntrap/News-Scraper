                            The boundary stand-off with China at the Doka La tri-junction with Bhutan is by all accounts
                            unprecedented; it demands calmer counsel on all sides. The tri-junction stretch of the
                            boundary at Sikkim, though contested, has witnessed far fewer tensions than the western
                            sector of the India-China boundary even as India and Bhutan have carried on separate
                            negotiations with China.

                            China’s action of sending People’s Liberation Army construction teams with earth moving
                            equipment to forcibly build a road upsets a carefully preserved peace.

                            Delhi has expressed disappointment over China’s rejection of its concerns on sovereignty
                            issues, and refusal to corner Pakistan on cross-border terrorism or help India’s bid for

                        <li>
                            In the immediate term, however, talks must focus on defusing the tensions at the

                        <li>
                            China has made the withdrawal of Indian troops a precondition for dialogue. This would be
                            unacceptable to India, unless the PLA also withdraws its troops and road-building teams.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Apart from its own commitments to the status quo, Beijing must recognise the special
                            relationship India and Bhutan have shared since 1947, the friendship treaty of 2007 that
                            commits India to protecting Bhutan’s interests, and the close coordination between the two
                            militaries.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For its part, India would be keen to show that it recognises that the face-off is in
                            Bhutanese territory, and the rules of engagement could be different from those of previous
                            India-China bilateral clashes — at Depsang and Demchok in the western sector, for example.

                            Bhutan’s sovereignty must be maintained as that is the basis for the “exemplary” ties
                            between New Delhi and Thimphu.

                            The Indian government has been wise to avoid escalation in the face of China’s aggressive
                            barrage, but that should not stop it from communicating its position in more discreet ways.

                                have reacted to the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and how it will

                                Following the implementation of the GST, the hospitality and travel sectors expect
                                teething issues in the first few months but are not unduly worried, expecting support

                                The Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) has approached the government to
                                reduce the restrictions on using duty credit scrips — a pass that allows holders to
                                import goods by not paying a certain amount in import duties.

                                that with GST, unorganised players will have to move to the organised form of doing

                                the India Meteorological Department for forecasts. The model will help prepare India’s
                                first home-grown forecast of climate change from global warming, and be part of

                                Dust clouds shield the earth from the sun’s rays, depressing land and sea temperatures.
                                The monsoon, which is produced by the difference in temperature between the two, is thus
                                weakened.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Talaq-e-bid’a cannot be excluded from the definition of “talaq” mentioned in Section 2 of the Muslim
                    Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As the Shariat Act was a law made before the Constitution came in force, it would fall within the
                    expression “laws in force” in Article 13(3)(b), and would be hit by Article 13(1) if found to be
                    inconsistent with Part III of the Constitution, to the extent of the inconsistency.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The two judges chose not to examine if the Narasu Appa Maliruling. This judgment had held that
                    personal laws cannot be tested against the provisions of Part III of the Constitution.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Biggest achievement was harmonisation of constitutional equality with Koranic egalitarianism.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This was done by endorsing the Koranic law of talaq mentioned in Shamim Ara and declaring
                    talaq-e-bid’a to be “manifestly arbitrary” and violative of Article 14
                </li>
                <li>
                    Because it allows a Muslim man to break the marriage “capriciously and whimsically” without
                    attempting to save it through reconciliation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On these grounds, Section 2 of the 1937 Act was struck down as being void to the extent that it
                    recognises and enforces instant talaq.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Talaq-e-bid’a falls outside the Shariahbecause it goes against its primary source, the Koran
                </li>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Declared talaq-e-bid’a to be an essential part of the Hanafi faith and gave it protection under
                    Article 25(1).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Given weight to the overwhelming evidence in the Koran and authentic hadeeses against instant talaq
                    they could have avoided the problematic invocation of Article 142 to direct the state to enact an
                    “appropriate legislation” on talaq-e-bid’a.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Article 13(2) clearly states that the “State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the
                    rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall, to the extent
                    of the contravention, be void.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The AIMPLB cited just one report from Sihah Sitta in which instant talaq is mentioned. But this
                    hadees does not show any Prophetic support for talaq-e-bid’a.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It clearly states that the man who pronounced “triple talaq” did so “without the Prophet’s command.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>

                    Implications of verdict
                </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Biggest achievement for Muslim women, that talaq-e-bid’ain any of his manifestations will not
                    dissolve the marriage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This renders redundant not just halala but the incorporation of a platitudinous advisory against
                    instant talaq in the
                    <strong>
                        nikahnama
                    </strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is also scope now to amend the 1937 Act, to exclude talaq-e-bid’a from the definition of the
                    word “talaq” mentioned in Section 2, and make the Koranic procedure of talaq gender-neutral.

                    <strong>
                        violative of the Constitution

                <li>
                    Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s directive to tax officials: make every effort to bring all traders,
                    including smaller businesses with turnover of less than ₹20 lakh, into the Goods and Services Tax
                    (GST) net.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Currently, traders with less than ₹20 lakh annual turnover have to register under GST only if they
                    are supplying goods to other States.
                </li>
                <li>
                    PM said he was dismayed at the huge pendancy of tax-related cases where huge sums of money that
                    could have been used for the welfare of the poor were locked up.
                </li>
                <li>
                    He also asked the officers to use data analytical tools to pro-actively track and determine
                    undeclared income and wealth
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mooting a time-bound solution for ‘tax raised and not realised,’ the PM said that human interface
                    must be kept to a minimum in the tax administration’s dealings by pushing “e-assessment” and
                    anonymity of proceedings using technology.

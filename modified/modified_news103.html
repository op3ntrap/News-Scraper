                        The Supreme Court has agreed to lay down the law on whether the Lieutenant Governor (LG) of
                        Delhi can unilaterally administer the National Capital without being bound by the “aid and
                        advice” of the elected government.

                    <li>
                        The Supreme Court has refused to stay the HC judgment, despite submissions by Delhi government
                        that the verdict “affects all future governments and all future relationships between the Centre
                        and the State”

                        The HC had upheld the LG’s power not only over the police, land and public order but also in
                        “services”. The judgment had effectively shrunk the Delhi Cabinet’s girth.

                        The 1996 judgment by the Supreme Court in North Delhi Municipal Corporation versus State of
                        Punjab clearly terms Delhi as a Union Territory in a class by itself.

                    <li>
                        The judgment observed that “the Union Territory of Delhi is in a class by itself but is
                        certainly not a State”. Union territories are in different stages of evolution.

                    <li>

                    <li>
                        Further, SEBI’s prior approval would be needed for acquisition of shares or voting rights in a
                        CRA that results in change in control.

                            Estimate by ICRA:
                        </strong>
                        the country’s microfinance sector will grow nearly three-fold to reach up to Rs 4.3 trillion
                        over the next three years on account of expansion into newer segments and enhanced average loan
                        sizes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The estimate includes micro credit across self-help groups, microfinance institutions and banks.

                        If the ticket sizes were to double from the current levels over the next 3-4 years and MFIs were
                        to increase their presence in under-penetrated areas, the microfinance market could reach Rs
                        3.3-4.3 trillion over the next 3 to 4 years. The assumption on the doubling of ticket sizes is
                        based on improving income levels, inflation, higher eligibility of borrowers moving to higher
                        loan cycles.

                    <li>
                        The MFI sector, excluding Bandhan Bank and teh SFBs, will need external capital of Rs 16-47
                        billion over the next three to four years.

                        While the business opportunity is exciting, there is a need for establishing a credit culture in
                        the new geographies and strengthening the credit appraisal processes.

                        The two operational credit bureaus have helped the sector maintain its asset quality. But there
                        are a few issues yet to be addressed like limited coverage of SHG bank linkage programme data,
                        issues related to multiple identity cards being used by borrowers for availing loans from more
                        than two MFIs and interlinking of retail credit.

                        2016, helped by regulatory decisions like data sharing through credit bureaus, cap of Rs 1 lakh
                        for overall borrowing and the stipulation for not more than two MFIs to lend to a single
                        borrower. However, “communal and political” incidents in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar,
                        Jharkhand and Karnataka did lead to some pressure on asset quality.

                                : In order for OSIRIS-REx to reach its destination in a reasonable timeframe, NASA
                                needed to find an asteroid which had a similar orbit to Earth. Around 7000 asteroids are
                                ‘Near-Earth Objects’ (NEOs), meaning they travel within around ~30million miles of the
                                Earth. Out of these, just under 200 have orbits similar to Earth, with Bennu being one
                                of these.

                                Small asteroids, those less than 200m in diameter, typically spin much faster than
                                larger asteroids, meaning the regolith material can be ejected into space. Bennu is
                                around 500m in diameter, so rotates slowly enough to ensure that the regolith stays on
                                its surface.

                                Bennu is a primitive asteroid, meaning it hasn’t significantly changed since the
                                beginning of the Solar System (over 4 billion years ago). It is also very carbon-rich,
                                meaning it may contain organic molecules, which could have been precursors to life on
                                Earth.
                            </li>

                                Additionally, Bennu is of interest as it is a Potentially Hazardous Asteroid (PHA).
                                Every 6 years, Bennu’s orbit brings it within 200,000 miles of the Earth, which means it
                                has a high probability of impacting Earth in the late 22nd Century.

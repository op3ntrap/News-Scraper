                    The Karnataka State government has constituted a nine-member committee headed by Principal

                </li>
                <li>
                    The Supreme Court has declared that federalism is a basic feature of the Constitution and States are
                    supreme in their sphere.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    This being the Constitutional position, there is no prohibition in the Constitution for the State to
                    have its own flag. However, the manner in which the State flag is hoisted should not dishonour the
                    national flag. It has to be always below the national flag.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The national flag code specifically authorises use of other flags subject to the regulation by the
                    court. So State flag is not unauthorized.

                and tactical procedures.

                    Researchers have found that the basic ingredient of turmeric, when administered in a nanoparticle

                    During the research, regular curcumin was able to drastically reduce liver toxicity induced by TB
                    drug isoniazid
                </li>
                <li>
                    Also, the treatment of TB with isoniazid along with 200 nanometre curcumin nanoparticles led to

                </li>
                <li>
                    Because of the increased bioavailability of curcumin, the duration of treatment to achieve complete

                    Quite often, patients stop taking anti-TB drugs for a few days due to liver toxicity

                <li>
                    Since the addition of curcumin reduces liver toxicity there can be better treatment and lesser risk

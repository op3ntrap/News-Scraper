                                    In the first scenario, utility scale solar (panels and parts), along with other
                                    renewable energy sources of electricity as well as coal, is taxed at 5%

                                <li>
                                    Analysis suggests that GST would result in a minor rise of 1.6% in solar tariffs

                                <li>
                                    In a thriving solar market, this is unlikely to create any setback for the sector

                                    While 5% doesn’t seem a mammoth figure, the rise in price of solar power is not
                                    insignificant when seen in conjunction with the decline in taxes on coal

                                    60% decline in taxation on coal is likely to make thermal power cheaper by as much
                                    as Rs 0.15

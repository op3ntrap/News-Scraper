                        According to Kommersant , sources said India committed several “unfriendly acts” towards Russia
                        and they threatened to seriously complicate negotiations, both on the lease of the second
                        nuclear submarine and other projects.

                        The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council slashed rates across the board, including for a range
                        of daily items of consumption, relaxed penalties and tweaked rules to make it easier for
                        businesses, especially small and medium enterprises, to comply.

                    <li>
                        The biggest rationalization was the decision to cut the tax rate on 178 items from 28% to 18%,
                        leaving only 50 items in the highest tax slab and offering major relief to consumers and

                    <li>
                        It comes into effect from 15 November, is likely to boost consumer demand, reduce disquiet over
                        compliance costs and also lend fresh momentum to the tax reform initiative.

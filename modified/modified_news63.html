                    Minister Maneka Gandhi has asked the National Commission for Women to be accessible to men who claim
                    to be falsely accused.

                    Maneka Gandhi has recommended a more stringent filing process which insists on identity proof, and

                    Besides, the court has prescribed that bail applications must be decided on the date of application.
                    Since bail is a right, courts may be more inclined to grant rather than withhold, which could again
                    increase the risk to the complainant.

                    The all India IIP is a composite indicator that measures the short-term changes in the volume of

        <strong>
            Context
        </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The sums insured under National Agriculture Insurance Scheme (NAIS), modified NAIS, and Weather Based Crop
            Insurance Scheme (WBCIS) were too low, as premiums were kept low and it was not based on any robust
            scientific system and had its own loopholes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Introduction of ‘Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana’ –was a path breaking scheme for farmers’ welfare
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna (PMFBY)- a game changer
        </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Raised the sums insured to realistic levels, basically to cover the cost of cultivation of farmers.
        </li>
        <li>
            The premiums were heavily subsidised by the Centre and the states in equal proportions
        </li>
        <li>
            compared to kharif year2013, the number of farmers opting for the scheme increased by 210 per cent in kharif
            2016, and the area covered increased by 126 per cent
        </li>
        <li>
            But the effectiveness of crop insurance scheme is based on how fast it can settle the claims of farmers. It
            is here that the governance of the state is tested
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Three critical steps in this process
        </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The state has to notify the crops, make clusters of districts, determine the sums to be insured based on
            district level committees, and invite tenders from insurance companies;
        </li>
        <li>
            The state and the Centre have to pay premium to the companies providing insurance; and
        </li>
        <li>
            In case of crop damages, quickly assess the damages and ask companies to pay the claims of farmers
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Challenges in the implementation
        </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If states delay notifications, or payment of premiums, or crop cutting data, companies cannot pay
            compensation to the farmers in time.
        </li>
        <li>
            Similarly, most states failed to provide smartphones to revenue staff to capture and upload data of crop
            cutting, which continues to come with enormous delay.
        </li>
        <li>
            There is hardly any use of modern technology in assessing crop damages.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Way forward
        </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            There is an urgent need to link the insurance database with Core Banking Solution (CBS) so that when premium
            is deducted from a farmer’s bank account, the bank sends him a message informing about the premium, sum
            insured and name of insurance company.
        </li>
    </ul>

            Rameshwar successfully cleared the prestigious civil services examination and was excited about the
            opportunity that he would get through the civil services to serve the country. However, soon after joining

        He found a number of malpractices prevailing in the department assigned to him. For example, funds under various
        schemes and grants were being misappropriated. The official facilities were frequently being used for personal
        needs by the officers and staff. After some time, he noticed that the process of recruiting the staff was also
        not up to the mark. Prospective candidates were required to write an examination in which a lot of cheating was
        going on. Some candidates were provided external help in the examination. Rameshwar brought these incidents to
        the notice of his seniors. However, he was advised to keep his eyes, ears and mouth shut and ignore all these
        things which were taking place with the connivance of the higher-ups. Rameshwar felt highly disillusioned and
        uncomfortable. He comes to you seeking your advice.
